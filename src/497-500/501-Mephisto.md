# 501 - Mephisto

Under Roy's wish to hear the details, Mephisto even hesitated, but he still told the trouble he had encountered.

Mephisto, known as the king of hatred, is recognized as a big boss-level demon no matter in the abyss or in the heavens and the world. There is no doubt about this and his resounding is spread in many worlds. The name, his dark believers can be said to be all over the world.

A demon of this level, it should be said that you can refer to where you want to fight, and destroy where you want to destroy. It is rare for opponents to run wild in the world, but the fact seems not to be the case.

As the saying goes, I often walk by the river. How can I not wet my shoes? If you walk a lot at night, you will always encounter ghosts... These words probably describe Mephisto.

After becoming a demon king, because of their own powerful power and destructiveness, it will be difficult for the demon kings to descend into some worlds with their own bodies, especially those low-energy worlds. If you want to summon the demon king's demon to descend, unless it is to organize a super large A large-scale sacrifice ritual, at the cost of hundreds of thousands or even millions of souls and lives, is it possible to break the shackles of the world effect and allow the demons of the Demon King order to go to these worlds.

But such sacrifice rituals are not easy to talk about. The dark sect that believes in demons is the target of everyone in every world, not to mention that there are angels monitoring behind them. The abyss world can be sacrificed on a large scale during such a long time. Sacrifice summoning the demon king's rank in the past, it can really be counted with one hand.

The low-energy world is too repulsive to the Demon King's rank and the high-energy world is relatively better. That is because the mysterious psychic power in the high-energy world can be used by the general public and the psychic power is used much naturally. It will interfere with the stability of the world effect, so there are often many loopholes in the high-energy world. It is not a big problem for the demon kings to descend on their bodies. Therefore, the more powerful the devil, the more they like to go to these high-energy worlds.

However, there are advantages and disadvantages. The demon kings can take advantage of the loopholes to go to the high-energy world, but the opponents they have to face are also not comparable to the low-energy world. In a world with highly active psychic energy, intelligent life can master the power It will be stronger, various mages, warlocks, astrologers and the like emerge in endlessly, and the best of them are so powerful that even the gods can defeat them!

Such a situation seems to be a kind of rule itself, so even a veteran demon like Mephisto dare not say that he can really rampage in the world.

In the past few thousand years, Mephisto has not been going well either. He and his clone have selectively traveled to several high-energy worlds, but they all encountered powerful opponents without exception...

"The first world I went to was quite special!" Mephisto said depressingly "That world has many parallel universes. I thought I could get a vote there, but I didn't expect it. Yes, there is a group of powerful wizards in the main world there. The leader is a guy called Gu Yi. He has different images in many parallel universes, but the only thing in common is that they all have powers comparable to gods. He is respected as the Supreme Master, the guardian of the main world..."

As soon as he heard the name Gu Yi, Roy immediately reacted. Mephisto said it should be the Marvel world. No wonder he would say that there are many parallel universes there. This is definitely the Marvel world.

"Originally, with my main body strength, I would not lose to the Supreme Mage!" Mephisto sighed "But the trouble is that the world has a very special gem, infinite gems! These infinite gems! There are six gems in total, each of which is as powerful as the power of the creator, but the Supreme Mage has a gem of time. I fought with him several times, but only retreated under the power of the gem of time... "

"You want to invite me to this world, right?" Roy frowned and asked, "You can't beat the Supreme Master. Do you think we can add up?"

Mephisto shook his head and said "Of course not, don't get me wrong. I want to invite you to go, not this weird world, to be honest. The power of the Supreme Master is too strong. It's also said that outside the universe, there are more The existence of the supreme mage. I don’t think I can do much in that world, so even I just left a clone there in the end, let the clone stay there first, and see if there are other opportunities in the future".

Roy shrugged and did not answer the conversation. Of course he could hear that Mephisto was from his heart.

Indeed, in that Marvel world, there are abundant powerful existences such as the Purple Sweet Potato, Spiritual Group, and so on. More fierce than the Supreme Master...

The Titans were originally created races born with angels and demons, and many Titans are even more talented than angels and demons. If Mephisto really wants to make a difference in that world, he won’t be able to make a difference. possible.

However, after these conversations, Roy also roughly understood what the trouble Mephisto was talking about. A great devil, suppressed by a human, could not arbitrarily ruin the entire world, and could only hide in the main world. Relying on signing a contract to play with people, create a ghost rider to have some fun for himself (or take a son) and then wait for the ambitious son who wants to win a position to rebel against him, then release the ghost rider to hang his son.

This kind of elderly life that can only entertain themselves is really bad enough for Mephisto, right?

Sure enough, Mephisto then talked about the various situations of the clone in the Marvel world after he left, which seemed to pour bitterness on Roy.

"After returning to the abyss world, I stayed for a while. This dark and endless abyss is comfortable, but it's really boring..." Mephisto said "So later, I went to another world, in that In the world, my other two brothers, Diablo and Baal, have been fighting with the archangels of the higher heavens. I think about going to activities with the angels. Some old friends have not seen you for a long time, and I miss them very much... "

"Diablo? Baal?" Roy understood, and said in a speechless manner "Could you mean to say that after you go, you will find that the situation is not good?"

Mephisto stamped his walking cane to the ground bitterly, and said, "That's right! It didn't take long for me to go to that world, and my two brothers and I were both tragically sealed one after another. It didn’t hold us for long, but it’s a shame for the devil! Those damn angels, they used humans and let them seal us with dark soul stones!"

"It looks like you got out of trouble later..." Roy glanced at him, rubbing his chin and said "But, did you leave another clone there?"

"It's because of leaving a clone to get out of trouble!" Mephisto said with a gloomy face "I also understand that creating a clone will be harmful, but I don't want to stay in the seal forever..."

"What about your two brothers, Diablo and [2] Baal?" Roy asked, "Are they still sealed?"

The reason for asking, Roy wanted to figure out the current time in the world of Diablo.

"During this period, my brother Diablo once escaped the seal once!" Mephisto said "That's because he left behind a back hand, he has a daughter of human blood, with the help of this blood. He escaped from the seal and took the demons to counterattack the high-level heaven, but at the last moment when the crystal dome was about to be destroyed, he was stopped by the [3] Archangel Tyrael...now he was sealed in the Dark Soul Stone again..."

"Uh..." Roy was a little speechless. He always felt that Mephisto and his three brothers were really troubled in that world, always cycling in the path of being sealed, breaking the seal, and then being sealed again.

Although I really want to vomit, Roy can roughly understand the current time of the Diablo World, which is probably a later point in Diablo III. It is estimated that Mephisto will leave and come to the Abyss World during this period of time. That plague angel [4] Malthael has already begun to be a demon, right? In that case, sealing the Dark Soul Stone of Diablo and the others is afraid that the seal will be lifted again, right?

After telling his general story, Mephisto focused his attention on Roy and said "I believe you have heard it too. I came to you this time because of this incident. My brothers and the three demon kings joined forces, but we have been unable to fix the world for a long time. On the contrary, we seem to be caught in a strange cycle in that world. Every time we want to do something, we will always be united by angels to humans. It’s destroyed, so I’m thinking, whether we need to introduce more variables to interfere, so that the evolution of that world can no longer continue like this!"

"Why did you think of looking for me?" Roy asked suspiciously "I don't believe that a veteran demon like you will not be able to contact other demon kings to help you."

Mephisto squinted his eyes, and a golden-red light flashed by in those eyes. He has regained his original gentleman manner at this moment and said "The clone of Rodin passed down to me in memory, this is one of them, And another more important reason is actually Lilith!"

"Lilith!?" Roy was slightly surprised "How could she be involved?"

"Huh, do you think ordinary humans have the power to defeat us?" Mephisto snorted coldly, and said bitterly "It's not all because of the good things Lilith did! She also came to that world back then. It’s not clear whether it’s a clone or a body, but he combined with an angel and created a new bloodline in that world nephalem/nephilim! That is a human being with angels and demons, with great potential, and now it grows up After that, it has become a huge obstacle! Although Lilith was banished later, the humans who now regard her as a mother are actually plotting to summon him back..."

"And you, Osiris!" Mephisto pointed to Roy and said, "You should have been in contact with Lilith, right? From the moment I entered your territory, I felt the breath of Lilith's Red Sea Egg. Just below your territory!"

"Yes, the Red Sea Egg is with me!" Roy nodded. He knew that Mephisto said that, he could really detect the Red Sea Egg's breath "It seems that you are looking for me. The purpose, is this egg of the Red Sea?"

"Yes!" Mephisto nodded, and said, "You may not know that the Red Sea Egg in your hand is actually Lilith's placenta! At least one of the placenta! Lilith used it to conceive nephalem/nephilim. It’s not heaven, so if you want to destroy those damn angel and demon hybrids, you must use the Red Sea Egg! Osiris, take it and go to that world with me. I promise you that it will be destroyed and captured in that world. After the high-level heaven, you will get the loot you deserve!"

"You... want me to face Lilith?" Roy looked at him strangely and said, "Are you serious?"

"Whether Lilith can return to that world depends on you and me. As long as the whole world is destroyed before the damn humans call her again, then she will never be able to return!"

## Change Notes

1. Name Changes
   - Nephitian and Nai -> nephalem/nephilim
     - In the Marvel world, the offspring of a demon and an angel are referred to as nephilim.
     - In the Diablo world, the offspring of a demon and an angel are also called nephalem.
     - I am using these terms to clarify the concept.
   - Barr -> Baal
     - One of demon king in Diablo World
2. Not sure about "Barr," it may be a typo for "Baal."
3. You can find references to Archangel Tyrael in the Diablo world.
4. I couldn't find any references to the character "Marsaier", i assume it Malthael because reference on later chapter
