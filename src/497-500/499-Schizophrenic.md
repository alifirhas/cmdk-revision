# 499 - Schizophrenic

"What are you talking about? Me... Mephisto???"

After receiving Berial's notification, the two mistresses, Julia and Benia, were a little confused for a while.

In the Abyss, there are trillions of demons living, but only a dozen can stand at the top. But it's not the case for first-generation demons. The original demon represents the seven deadly sins. Besides Lilith, Queen of the Red Sea, there are several second-generation demon kings in the Abyss world.

Unlike Roy, the demon king who just came to power, the second generation of demon kings have existed in the abyss world for a long, long time. This long time is at least calculated in units of ten thousand years. In such a long time, the demon kings of the second generation naturally also gained a reputation among the ten thousand realms. Their resounding names are not only spread in the Abyss but also spread throughout the human world and the heavens.

The angles of High Heaven don't always pursue their death, but at the same time, both sides will win and lose to the other side, resulting in a delicate balance.

As the passage of time goes on, the achievements of the second generation of demons have also given them new titles.

Hate, lies, torture, pain, fear, sin, destruction, and the same titles with negative emotions, represent the highest honor of the abyss world. These seven second-generation demon kings are also in the eyes of the abyss world’s demons. Seven Sins Devil!

Among these seven new evil kings, Mephisto - the king of hatred, Baal - the king of destruction, and Diablo - the king of fear, there of them are the most famous!

Among the thirteen great demon kings recognized by the abyss world, they all occupy a seat. As for the king of lies, Belial and [^1] Andariel, they are more controversial...

However, in the last few thousand years, it has been difficult to see these seven new sin kings in the abyss world. It is said that among the news spread by the demons, these seven new sin kings seem to have fallen into a super high world. It's hard to get out, and stuck directly...

Arriving at the ranks of the demon king, it is almost impossible to kill the soul forever, but it is difficult to be killed, but it does not mean that it will not be sealed. If the demon kings encounter powerful archangel enemies, it might not be possible. It’s also going to roll over. The Abyss World once had the Demon King being sealed by a single seal for tens of thousands of years. Therefore, even if it is difficult to see the traces of the activities of a few new Sin Demon Lords in the Abyss World, the demons did not think it was a big deal. After all, they still have to live their respective lives.

When Roy met Rodin in the world of Devil May Cry before, Rodin called himself Mephisto. Since he dared to call himself this way, it means that Rodin is a clone of Mephisto, but this matter is only Roy and Rodin. [^2] Roy didn't mention it to Julia and the others afterward, so when they heard the name suddenly, Julia and Benia seemed so surprised.

To welcome the arrival of the veteran Demon King Mephisto, Frostfire City immediately rushed out, and the four demon lords, plus Julia and Benia, came to greet Mephisto with many demons.

At the same time, they also asked Sareth to quickly call Roy back.

Mephisto let out a sigh of approval, "Well, not bad!" As he approached the gate of Frostfire City, he carried a walking cane, exuding an air of sophistication. Pausing for a moment, he gazed at Frostfire City, nodding in admiration at the splendid sight before him.

"Your Majesty Mephisto, a warm welcome to your presence," Julia and Benia genuflected, conveying their respect to Mephisto alongside the others. "May we know about the purpose of your visit this time?" they asked with deference.

Mephisto, who looked like a human, glanced at Julia, a golden-red light flashed in his eyes, and seemed to use some power to observe Julia, and then said with a little surprise "So it's you... My child, your power has gone a step further. It looks like the soul of Archangel Jubileus, you have almost digested it!"

Julia was stunned for a while, wondering how Mephisto knew about it, but she cleverly didn't say anything.

"It appears I've timed my visit well," Mephisto mused to himself as he strolled into the city, his walking cane in hand. With Julia by his side, the entourage followed closely behind.

"I have come to meet your king, Osiris. I wonder if he can spare some time to meet an old man like me?" Mephisto inquired.

"Rest assured, we have already sent someone to inform him of your arrival," Benia responded in a hushed tone.

"Ah, the Lilim are quite capable as well!" Mephisto glanced back at Benia upon hearing her reply and nodded appreciatively.

Lilim is another name for succubus, which means daughter of Lilith. The succubus has this name for the entire race, but nowadays such a name is rare, only those older demons, still maintain this tradition of calling succubus. Benia immediately realized that Mephisto in front of her might really be the old monster of the Abyss...

Upon entering Frostfire City, Mephisto wasted no time in being courteous. He toured the city, exploring its surroundings before eventually settling in the castle hall, right next to the throne. Carefully placing his cane beside him, he meticulously tidied up his well-groomed hair, as if getting ready for a formal meeting.

Ignoring this current situation, Mephisto could easily be mistaken for a genuine human gentleman; his demeanor exuded an air of sophistication that would surely deceive many.

He waited quietly, while Julia and Benia were filled with unease. Mephisto had arrived alone. Although it was unlikely that he had ill intentions, the abyss world had always warned that one demon king should not encounter another, for the nature of the devil made it difficult to predict the outcome when two demons of such high stature meet. It was true that no one could guarantee it would turn out well...

"I hope they don't fight... Frostfire City has just been rebuilt, if it is destroyed again, it will be a problem..." Julia and Benia whispered to themselves.

Mephisto has been waiting a bit long, but he has been quietly waiting. After so long, a smile suddenly appeared on his face, he stood up, and said: "There he is".

In the blink of an eye, myriad mists materialized from the space, converging to form Roy's body.

The fog's volume was substantial, and as Roy reappeared, he cast a condescending gaze at Mephisto. However, to Mephisto's credit, he remained unperturbed and instead observed Roy's body with keen interest.

Roy was also a little surprised when he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. Sareth didn’t say anything clearly when he hurried to find him, so he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. At first glance, Roy felt that his eyes were blurred.

"Ha, little friend Osiris, we meet again!" Mephisto opened his arms with a smile, looking forward to a hug.

"..." Roy was silent for a while, and then reacted, so the misty body shook and shrank, and quickly condensed the same human appearance.

He appears to be oriental, with lustrous black hair and eyes. However, there is a peculiar quality to his facial features and overall appearance, giving them a slightly indistinct or fuzzy aspect.

There is no doubt that this is what Roy looked like when he was a human. During the period of retreat, he was finally able to control his foggy body to simulate other images. Roy sees that Mephisto is taking the form of a human, making Roy subconsciously imitate his original appearance.

It's just that... the passage of time has been so extensive that Roy can no longer recall his original appearance, which has led to this ambiguous visage. Nevertheless, his black hair and eyes remain distinctly discernible.

Observing Roy's transformation into human form, Mephisto appeared mildly surprised, but quickly broke into a laugh and said, "Well, it seems we share a common likeness now, don't we?"

While acclimating to this human body, Roy inquired of Mephisto, "Have you somehow accessed Rodin's memories? And across such vast distances in time and space, can you still maintain a connection with your clone?"

"That's right!" Mephisto nodded, but then sighed "But it's just a memory. Those clones have formed their independent personalities over the long years and they have even been completely connected to those worlds. They linked together and are no longer willing to return to me..."

Roy nodded and didn't speak. When he first met Rodin, he discovered that Rodin's clone already had the power of the Demon King rank. In such a situation, it is really hard to tell who is the clone and who is the main body.

Just like Julia, you would say that she is a clone of Jubileus, that's correct, but now that she gradually merges Julia's soul, then she becomes the body instead.

Within the Ten Thousand Worlds, numerous opportunities and potential dangers exist and Roy knows this. Over time, ancient demons and angels have shown him the consequences of carelessness. As a Junior, if Roy fails to learn these lessons, he would truly be foolish.

With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Roy took a seat on the throne in the hall and gestured for Mephisto to join him. "No wonder Rodin hinted that we would meet again soon. Back then, he must have shared his memories with you through the Book of Changes, right? So, are you the original entity?" Roy inquired.

"Who can say for certain?" Mephisto's face broke into an enigmatic grin. It was only then that his non-human essence became apparent. He chuckled and replied, "Perhaps I believe I am the original, but in truth, I might be a mere clone as well..."

"...Well, it seems all avatars are a bit eccentric!" Roy couldn't help but grumble inwardly as he observed Mephisto's peculiar demeanor. "The devil, or whatever it is, is simply a schizophrenic..."

Mephisto’s incarnation has so many images in the world, so that no one knows what his real body looks like, so no one can say whether the body in front of him is his body. Okay. Roy didn’t struggle too much and he said directly “I thought Rodin said, I’m afraid it will be a couple of hundred years later. I didn’t expect you to find it so soon. Let’s talk about it. What's the matter?"

"I'm here this time, firstly, to see you, the newly promoted Demon King. After all, the Abyss World has not witnessed the birth of a new Demon King in quite some time..." Mephisto spoke with deliberate slowness. "Secondly, I have an invitation for you!"

"Invitation?" Roy looked at him suspiciously.

"Yes, an invitation!" Mephisto nodded, a hint of perplexity creeping into his voice. "I believe you've noticed it too. After attaining the rank of Demon King, despite our tremendous power, we find ourselves increasingly confined. The worlds you've visited before can now be accessed through the gates of the abyss, right? So, wouldn't you like to break free from these constraints?"

Roy paused, carefully examining Mephisto's persuasive expression, before breaking into a smile. "Certainly, the idea of unhindered access to the Ten Thousand Realms is appealing, but wouldn't it be a simple matter to locate high-energy worlds on my own? Why would I require your invitation?"

## Notes

### Name Changes

- Belie -> Belial
  - Belie has been changed to Belial, who is known as the King of Lies in The Demonic Paradise and also appears as Lord Belial in Mairimashita! Iruma-kun.
- Civilized rod -> Walking Cane

### RV Note

[^1]: Regarding a close name for Andariel, considering the exclusions of Demon Kings that have been mentioned (7 deadly sins, Mephisto, Baal, Diablo, and Belial), there are three potential options: Astaroth, Abaddon, and Azazel. Choosing among them is challenging. However, let's exclude Leviathan from the question.
[^2]: There are instances where the pronoun "I" appears frequently, but it is very out of context.
