# 497 - This is a bit embarrassing

In the dark, deep and silent bottom world of the abyss, fragmented spaces move randomly like Brownian motion.

Only when you enter these fragmented spaces you will know that there are different small worlds. Some of these small worlds may be as small as a few squares of land, but some can be large enough to accommodate several cities.

The fragmented world beneath is a world exclusively belonging to the survival of upper demons. Those who can enter and leave here are at least at the upper demon rank. However, the upper demons can only be regarded as residents here. The real ruler here is a demon lord!

No one knows how many demon lords exist in this fragmented world, but there is no doubt that every relatively large fragmented world may be the territory of a demon lord. The demon lords use their powerful power to protect their own fragmented worlds, while at the same time fighting for territory with other demon lords openly or secretly. The winner lives and the loser dies. The cruel rules of the abyss world are also vividly reflected here and this over ten million years is the main melody in this fragmented world...

In recent years, among the demons in the Fragmented World, there has been news that a new Frost Demon Lord was born. This Frost Demon Lord named Osiris has occupied a huge ice habitat in the Fragmented World as a Territory and was victorious in disputes with several other demon lords.

Among the demons who have witnessed the passing of millennia, spanning approximately two thousand years, the news of the Frost Demon's reemergence as a lord circulates among them. When these ancient demons convene in private, they share nostalgic sighs and jestingly speculate about why the Frost Demon has yet to broach the subject of extinction.

Why is there such a discussion? That’s because the demon who is more informed knows that in recent years, there has been a special and powerful demon force that is capturing the Frost Demon group. As for what this demon force is doing to capture the Frost Demon, they don’t know much about it. They just know that the Frost Demon who was captured has never returned to the Abyss World...

So under this circumstance, the newly promoted Frost Demon Lord looks a bit different and unique, so some other Demon Lords are considering whether to find the location of the Frost Demon Lord first. In their opinion, it is estimated that this Frost Demon Lord will be captured by that group of demon forces in a short time and logically they'll be able to take his territory.

As for whether that group of demons can capture a Frost Demon Lord, no one has ever doubted it, because anyone who has been in contact with this group of demons understands how terrifying the power behind this group of demons is...

Calculating the time, it seems that demons will reappear in the abyss world soon...

***

Frostfire City, Roy's territory, the surface world here is still howling cold, the extremely harsh cold even the devil can hardly bear, so that almost no living creatures can be seen moving on the surface.

Deep beneath the surface, an unusual sight unfolds. Countless demons toil diligently in this fiery domain. Squatting low, they employ their sharp devil's claws to burrow through the soil, fervently seeking something. Brilliant red flares, emanating scorching heat, are the object of their quest. After unearthing these flares, they diligently pile them into carts drawn by demon worms. These formidable creatures effortlessly haul dozens of tons of ore. Once the demon worms reach the banks of the underground river, coursing with molten lava, they arch their bodies and release the flares into the fiery flow.

The high temperature of the magma river can make preliminary refining of the ore. Impurities and soil will melt in the river, and the flares that can withstand the high temperature will emit a stronger red light, then move slowly under the flow of the river. After arriving at the second location of the mine, there will be flying fire demons salvaging these flares. After loading the truck, the demon worm will pull it back to the surface and store it in the warehouse.

The mining operation appears surprisingly well-organized, even though this operation manages by a demon. However, that is exactly what it is. Under the dominion of higher-ranking demons, the low-rank demons have become more compliant. Other creatures in this realm also stand taller, as they are accustomed to executing the orders of their superior demon overlords.

Even during Roy’s absence, the mining work here has not been affected in any way, but recently the high-ranking demons who are responsible for guarding the warehouse are a little worried. The cause of their worries is the flares are about to be mined. The warehouse is full, but the lord has not yet returned. They don’t know whether to continue to expand the warehouse or find a way to trade these flares...

The demons are good at fighting and fighting, but it’s a bit difficult for them to do things like trading. Among the thousands of demons, they may not be able to find a few countable...

Just when the upper demons were thinking about it, the gate of the abyss arranged in Frostfire City finally moved. The breath that belonged to the gate of the abyss was spreading, and the upper demons who felt this breath reacted immediately. This is the opening of the gate of the abyss, and it must be the Lord, Lord who has returned!

As a result, the high-ranking demons in the management immediately flew towards the main castle, preparing to welcome the return of their lord Osiris.

However, when they rushed to the gate of the abyss, they discovered that the area and area of ​​the gate of the abyss were unprecedentedly huge this time! The height alone has reached several thousand meters, and the area covered almost covers most of Frostfire City!

Such a huge gate of the abyss had never been seen by the upper demons before. They raised their heads in astonishment to look at the gate of this ultra-standard abyss, not knowing what had happened.

But soon, one figure after another appeared from the gate of the abyss. The upper demons quickly recognized the two first mistresses, Lord Julia and Lord Benia, then they also appeared behind them. Cassandra the Lich, and Sareth.

It was indeed the Lord who had returned. The upper demons realize it and hurriedly flew forward to greet them.

However, Benia sternly warned them, "Get back everyone, get back!"

Upon cautioning them to get back, the two mistresses swiftly proceed to enlarge the size of the Abyss Gate, allowing the people emerging from the other side to pass through rapidly. As if that something has gone wrong with this large gateway of the abyss.

The upper demons could only follow quickly. When they flew beside Julia and Benia, they discovered that there were more figures in the team that they didn't recognize.

In the air, a female demon soars with two enormous butterfly and phoenix-tailed wings trailing behind her. Along her flight path, black and purple powders scatter, causing distress to any upper demons that come into contact with them. These powders contain a highly toxic substance.

Beside her, a male demon accompanied her in the form of a massive fire bull, emanating a commanding aura. Flames engulfed his expansive wings, and in his hand, he brandished a colossal sword of fire. Though he bore the appearance of a formidable hell master, his countenance now betrayed signs of panic as he hurriedly followed Mistress Julia, their escape route leading through the abyssal gate.

In addition to these two demons, there are two other demons. Although they are smaller in size, there is no doubt that they both exude a strong aura.

The upper demons in Frostfire City looked at these four demons with trepidation. They were not ignorant people and they could see that they were four demon lords behind Mistress Julia and Mistress Benia.

The resident of Frostfire though, What happened? Why did Lord Osiris go to a certain world from the Gate of the Abyss, and then suddenly four more Demon Lords came back after returning!?

Fortunately, the upper demons are not stupid. They feel strange, but they can still see that the four more demon lords belong to their side. They dare not say anything, they can only flee in confusion...

[^1] A group of people soars through the skies, while on the ground, you can spot Fat Tiger running, closely followed by a smaller hell-hound. The three-headed dog is none other than Cerberus, desperately chasing after Fat Tiger. Its three heads lean up to smell Fat Tiger's tail from time to time, and all three dog faces display a mischievous smirk. Having completed their adventure in the world of Devil May Cry, they return to their home.

Rafaro’s figure is flying in the sky. After going to Devil May Cry, his body has grown larger and slender again. This is because of the centipede lord that Roy kill. Scolopendra's soul was taken from Frostmourne and it was swallowed by Rafaro. It can be said that Rafaro now also has the same power as the Demon Lord.

The four demon lords who were already under his command, along with Rafaro and Julia, born from the merger of Julia and Benia, brought the total number of demon lords under Roy's authority to six.

If Roy had not become a demon king now, he would have been a bit difficult to manage this group of demon lords...

Having successfully escaped and widened the gate for a considerable duration, Julia and Benia gazed at the ultra-standard abyss gate in Frostfire City, their hearts gripped by worry and lingering fear.

"How could this happen?" Julia said madly "The gates of the abyss have expanded so much, why is Osiris still stuck!?"

"No way, his current strength is too strong..." Benia said helplessly and proudly.

Yes, no one would have thought that the first problem Roy, who had been promoted from the crown to the majesty after returning to the abyss world, turned out to be that he was stuck at the gate of the abyss...

This is a bit embarrassing...

## Note
