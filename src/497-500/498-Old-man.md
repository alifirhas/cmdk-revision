# 498 - Old man

The gate of the abyss in Frostfire City was made by Roy himself.

If Roy walked through the gate that other demon kings left behind in the abyss world, the situation might be better, but he walked through the gate in the center of Frostfire City... because when he made the gate of the abyss, Roy still It’s just the rank of the demon lord, so he didn’t think too much at the time. The energy given to the gate of the abyss was only able to accommodate him passing through at that time, but he never expected it to accommodate a demon king.

It is not easy for a creature with extremely high energy in its body to pass through any door of space. The reason is that their energy often affects the stability of space. Now Roy’s energy has far exceeded the spec when the Abyss Gate was designed, causing him to be stuck even if the Abyss Gate was expanded to the limit.

If you don’t want to be so stuck in the space tunnel, Roy has only one choice, and that is to use his power to directly break through the abyss gate and squeeze in forcibly, but this may cause the abyss gate to explode. Julia and others understood this and led everyone to evacuate Frostfire City.

"I just don't know how powerful the explosion will be. It would be better if only Frostfire City was destroyed. After all, the city could be rebuilt..." Julia said with some worry "I'm afraid that the explosion will be too powerful. The space is blown up, then... we can only find another habitat."

Hearing this, Berial, the overlord of Hell, interrupted and said "If I find another territory, then I still like places with flames and high temperatures. It's too cold here..."

This guy was a little bit ignorant about his words, so Julia and Benia stared at him fiercely before his voice hadn't lost his voice.

It was originally, your boss Osiris is a Frost Demon, and the territory he is looking for must be a cold region. Even if you are a Fire Demon, you have to stay obediently...

In the eyes of everyone’s worry, the widened gate of the abyss began to twist. This distortion knew that it had entered an unstable state. They knew that Roy had begun to forcefully break through the gate of the abyss, so they retreated subconsciously, far... far away.

With time, the distortion of the gate of the abyss became more and more serious, and finally with a light "pop", one of Roy's arms finally pierced the space barrier and got out!

After the arm came out, Roy's entire body squeezed out, but his series of actions also caused the space channel constructed by the gate of the abyss to be completely disintegrated, and the violent sound of glass shattering spread throughout the entire space!

The spatial fissures extended their influence to every building in Frostfire City, causing numerous cracks to form, akin to a photograph torn into countless fragments. Despite the fragments still holding together, the structural integrity of the buildings had been severely compromised, and it seemed inevitable that they would crumble to dust as the space collapsed.

After Roy got out, he also discovered this. He originally wanted to try to save Frostfire City, but then found that the space fragmentation was spreading to the entire fragmented world. As a last resort, Roy could only find a way to keep the space crack contain within Frostfire City, and not spread to a much larger area.

After a while, Frostfire City which covers an area of ​​nearly a hundred kilometers, suddenly fell into a collapse. All the buildings, and even the ground nearly two kilometers below the surface, instantly turned into countless dust and particles, and in the space Under the contraction effect, they converged to a point in the center at once and then disappeared completely.

The space collapse spanned across a vast circular area, leaving distinct and tidy edge marks beyond its reach. The once bustling city was now completely gone, replaced by a colossal round pit that marked its previous location.

As Roy hovered in the air like a mist, a sense of relief washed over him. Though he couldn't rescue Frostfire City entirely, he successfully prevented the fragmentation from spreading further. Roy had developed an affinity for this environment, even though his current bloodline surpassed that of the Frost Demon. He still cherished and adapted well to the cold and tranquil surroundings. Among the myriad fragmented worlds in the abyss, it wasn't effortless to find a location with the same vastness as this one.

After Julia and the others came back to rejoin Roy, those high-ranking demons who had stayed in Frostfire City were surprised to find that the strange demon in front of them was their former lord.

But then, they immediately felt the strong and coercive aura exuding from Roy's body, an aura that would make them fall to the ground and shiver and worship.

"Lord Osiris has become a demon king!?" After the upper demons were astonished, there was a big surprise that followed and they were going crazy with excitement!

A true Demon King holds greater significance for demons than a mere Demon Lord. Every Demon King stands as an idol for all demons, commanding immense respect and admiration. In the hierarchical concept of demons, obeying a Demon Lord might position them as subordinates, but following a Demon King elevates their perception to that of a master, fostering a profound sense of loyalty and reverence.

This is a completely different sense of belonging!

Therefore, after discovering that their lord was successfully promoted to the demon king, all demons who stayed behind in Frostfire City became extremely restless. A fever and excitement filled their bodies, which could only be heard Roaring and dancing to vent their emotions.

This led to the spectacle of demons dancing in Frostfire City at this moment...

Roy in the misty state looked a little speechlessly at the densely packed demons crying and howling below him. He didn't understand what they were excited about.

"My dear, are you okay?" Julia and Benia gathered next to Roy and asked with concern.

Roy sadly nods. He is in good condition now. The space burst and explosion just now looked quite dangerous, but it's still a pity that Frostfire City's gone "Looks like we have to reconstruct from the start".

Soon after that, Sareth narrowed his mouth and said "Foster father, all my toys are gone..."

Roy stretched out his misty hand and pretended to rub Sareth's head, to comfort him and fortunately, it made Sareth smile again.

On the contrary, Cassandra looked at Roy thoughtfully and said, "Master, will you always be like this in the future?"

"I don't know, but..." Roy looked down at his body and said, "Theoretically, I should be able to simulate any appearance now... although I need a little time to do it. There has been a huge change in my abilities."

Benia nodded and said, "Well, let us rebuild the territory next. You can concentrate on adapting to the various changes in your body. Besides..."

She licked her tongue and charmingly said "Hurry up and change back. I still like the way you were before... the Frost Demon. I don't want to have night activity with a cloud of smoke..."

"..." Julia and Roy were a little speechless when they heard it. Benia was indeed a succubus who have the nature to speak straightforwardly.

"Then I leave it to you for the rebuild process!" Roy looked around and said "The city is gone. I will go down to the ground. The Demon Lord Beelzebub's lair is a good place. I will stay there to adapt to my strength for a while. If you want to find me, go there and find me!"

"Understood!" Everyone nodded.

Then Roy explained to the four demon lords, Madam Styx and Berial, asking them to find a place to settle down outside of Frostfire City. Roy allowed them to recruit their subordinates by themselves. After all, they are also demon lords, what would be a demon lord without subordinates?

As per Roy's strategy, he intended to assign the four demon lords to protect Frostfire City from four directions to emphasize the importance of the Demon King City's central position.

After the explanation, Roy turned into a flowing mist and plunged into the ground.

With his mist-like body in a non-physical state, Roy effortlessly traversed through any material substance. Moreover, the particles within his form possessed the ability to manipulate space, enabling him to achieve a skill surpassing that of the Flash, resembling more of a Space Displacement ability.

These are some of the ability changes that Roy is currently faintly experiencing, but it seems that it is far more than these. So after drilling into the ground, Roy went all the way and soon came to the place where Beelzebub's carcass was discovered.

Back here, he used the power of the Red Sea Egg to fuse the legacy of Beelzebub, thus gaining the wind magic circuit and the power of the bug-type demon. It's a pity that Roy hasn't used this ability much before the promotion, but he has already completed the promotion of the Demon King Rank.

The mist body is undoubtedly elegant, powerful, and convenient, yet the absence of a tangible form leaves Roy with a lingering sense of discomfort. He contemplates the possibility of researching, with the aid of the system, a way to re-utilize his original physical body.

While Roy study his new ability and others did not disturb Roy tacitly. They turned their attention to the reconstruction of Frostfire City. Under their command, the enthusiastic and excited demons were working like a raging fire.

There is no distinction between day and night in the fragmented world, and the passage of time is naturally not so easy to detect. Don’t know how long it has been, half a year or a year. In short, when the reconstruction of Frostfire City was about to be completed, a figure suddenly appeared in In this fragmented world.

This is a strange... human being! He has the appearance of a kind old man, wearing a neat white suit, and he walks leisurely in the lonely and cold ice field. While walking, he looks at the surrounding scene with interest. Although he moves slowly, his goal is very clear, that is, Frostfire City in the center of the ice field.

The first person to discover this human was Rafaro that fly in the sky. When he found this figure, even Rafaro was shocked. This is the bottom layer of the abyss world, how could a human appear!?

Rafaro quickly issued a warning message for the first time, so it didn’t take long for the Hell Overlord Berial, who was guarding in this direction, to appear with a large number of demons, and surrounded the white suit old man on the ice field.

Facing a large number of demons, the old man still had a smiling face. When Berial saw him, he felt that something was wrong.

"You shouldn't be a real human..." Berial held his blazing sword, looked down at the old human man, and sniffed vigorously "You have a strong demonic aura... Who are you? This is the territory of His Majesty Osiris, what do you want to do here?"

"Hahaha!" The old man chuckled, adjusting his suit with both hands before lifting his head to meet Berial's gaze. "I've come to seek your king, and his demon goes by the name Osiris... or perhaps I misspoke. Please inform him that Mephisto has arrived!"

Berial's bulging eyes widened suddenly, "M-Mephisto!?"

At that moment, cold sweat broke out on his body, and he felt grateful that he hadn't acted impulsively upon encountering the human form of the mysterious figure. Otherwise, he couldn't fathom the consequences.

"I... I'll report..." Berial hastily lowered his body, striving to diminish his presence, then turned his head and paid no heed to his fellow demons. He hurriedly made his way back to Frostfire City.

Meanwhile, the old human man, who introduced himself as Mephisto, maintained a gentle smile as he continued to move slowly with his hand resting casually on his back.

## Notes

### Name Changes

- Balrog -> Fire Demon
  - I presume Balrog refers to Berial, but Fire Demon fits a more general term.
