# 509 - Tyrael Decision

Under the leadership of the three survivors, five days later, the Horadrim team that went to the Terrified Land successfully stood in front of the black tower again.

This team is the regular army of the Horadrim Church. All the Nephalems in the team are elite warriors who have experienced battles. The Nephalems in Sanctuary are like this. After the influence of the World Stone dissipated, The more they fight, the more they can stimulate their own bloodline. So as to continuously gain more powerful knowledge and power from the inheritance of bloodline, although it is not to say that the older they are, the more powerful they are, but the stronger they are.

This elite Nephalem regular army, after entering the tower, showed a rolling forward attitude. The soft limbs in the tower were powerless to stop them. The tentacles were chopped into pieces, and a large number of powerful magics from the mages burned these tentacles to ashes. The strange poison of the witch doctors blocked the regeneration speed of the tentacles' limbs. They easily advanced all the way to the top of the tower and came to In front of the octopus demon.

The world of Sanctuary also has oceans, but everyone has never seen such an ugly octopus, nor has they ever seen such a big one.

This octopus demon has a mouth full of dense teeth. The teeth are divided into several layers in the mouth, as terrifying as a rotating meat grinder. Hundreds of compound eyes are stacked on its head. From any angle, it looks like it's staring at you viciously.

Dark power as thick as ink flows around its body, and elemental power such as flames, frost, lightning, and etc keeps flashing at the base of its tentacles, indicating its extraordinary power.

When the Nephalem appeared in front of it, the terrifying octopus demon opened its mouth and let out a heart-piercing roar. The stench of disgusting breath poured out from its densely toothed mouth, and countless tentacles began Squiggling, the mucus on it brought out threads like cobwebs, and the next second it launched an attack directly at the Nephalem.

The Nephalems spread out and started to fight the Octopus Demon in small teams. The barbarians danced their axes like crazy and rushed to the front. Crusader soldiers and monks defended him on both sides, and hunted in the back. The demon's crossbow arrows flew out like raindrops and shot towards the eyes of the octopus demon, while the mages waved their fluorescent staffs, and the powerful meteorite magic slammed down...

Under such a huge offensive, the solid black tower could not help but send out a huge tremor, giving people a shaky feeling.

"Strange, although it is a lord-level demon, it doesn't look like the kind that is wise and can't communicate at all?"

During the battle, the Nephalems quickly discovered some strange places, so they couldn't help but communicate when the battle was spare.

"Not only that, what's even more strange is that such a powerful demon has no soul!" A pale-faced necromancer said: "At least I didn't detect the breath of the soul from it!"

As necromancers who use undead magic and deal with corpses all day, they know the soul the most. They all say that this octopus demon has no soul, that is, it really doesn't exist.

"It feels like this guy is like a man-made demon!" A mage nodded in agreement.

"But who made it?"

No one can answer this question, but everyone is in a haze, because they all understand that if they want to create a lord-level artificial demon, it means that the maker has more powerful power.

Today, when the Seven Demon Kings are temporarily gone, all they can think of is the new Demon King who just came to this world not long ago...

This strange octopus demon may be the experiment of the demon king. Is he already trying to create his army of demons, ready to destroy the world?

Thinking of this, everyone couldn't help but increase the intensity of the attack again. After a little effort, the octopus demon was finally cut into eight pieces by everyone and burned into a pile of coke.

"Huh..." After seeing that the octopus demon was unable to regenerate and finally died, everyone was relieved.

They collected some of the remains of the octopus demon and prepared to take them back for the mages in the church to study and see if it was possible to find any clues from these remains. After collecting them, they turned their attention to Turned to the Kanai's Cube placed on a disposal table.

This boxy box is about the size of a washbasin. The dark golden metal surface is engraved with some inexplicable patterns. At first glance, it really looks like Kanai's Cube. For those of Kanai's Magic Box, they can see the difference between it and the real one at a glance.

"It's not Kanai's Cube!" exclaimed the team leader, a Mage, as he carefully cast a discerning spell. "Although it bears a faint demonic aura, the box possesses a distinct and potent power of its own. I can say with certainty that it is not Kanai's Cube. Furthermore, the rune pattern adorning it is completely dissimilar to that of Kanai's Cube."

"No matter what it is, take it back and talk about it first!" A savage said, "I think, since this thing looks similar to Kanai's Cube, maybe the demons want to imitate Kanai's Cube did that."

"Indeed, so maybe this thing has the same effect as Kanai's Cube. Let's take it back and let the mages of the church test it!"

However, some people suddenly worried about the tunnel "Wait, is it really good to take it back like this? What if this is a devil's trap?"

"Anyway, let Lord Tyrael take a look first. If there are any traps, he should be able to find them!"

After discussing for a while, everyone made a decision. They took this counterfeit Kanai's Cube out of the tower. The mages recruited meteorites again and completely destroyed the black tower into ruins before everyone opened it. Go through the portal and evacuate from the land of fear.

After the expedition team returned, the counterfeit Kanai's Cube was quickly returned to the church. Out of concern for a possible demon trap, the church found Archangel Tyrael and handed the Kanai's Cube to the church. Tyrael looks.

Tyrael was also very careful, so he checked it very carefully, but after he verified it with various methods, he found that he couldn't see anything at all.

On the contrary, during this verification process, Tyrael discovered the purpose of this counterfeit Kanai's Cube.

This is indeed a very powerful alchemical item. It has the same principle as the real Kanai's Cube. It can be synthesized into some powerful magic equipment by adding materials, although it is completely different from the alchemy formula of Kanai's Cube, but the use is the same.

Overall, this is an alchemical creation very similar to Kanai's Cube.

After a little experimental verification, Tyrael quickly stopped and did not dare to continue, because he found that the equivalent of this box in the process of alchemy turned out to be... soul! It doesn't need too many complicated and hard-to-find magic materials, it just needs to invest souls in the process of making magic equipment, and the more souls you put in, the stronger the effect will be!

"It's an extremely evil creation!" Tyrael held the box and said with lingering fears: "Now I can be sure that it is indeed something made by demons, because no one except demons will use the soul as an equivalent to carry out Alchemy!"

"Seal it!" Tyrael made a decision "This thing must be sealed!"

No one will question Tyrael's decision, although some mages of the Horadrim Church are also wondering why they don't try to destroy this evil demon creation, but think that maybe this thing is not so easy to destroy, so it is also Instead of raising this issue, they all agreed with Tyrael's decision.

"This thing can't be touched by anyone!" Tyrael said "You can get powerful magical equipment just by using your soul. I'm worried that people who can't control themselves will touch and use it secretly, so it must be sealed in A safe place."

"Just put it in the Rakkis tomb that seals the dark soul stone!" Tyrael finally made a decision.

When the mages of the Horadrim Church heard this decision, they couldn't help but look at each other, their eyes were full of strange looks, but then no one questioned...

So, the matter was settled like this. This counterfeit Kanai's Cube was sent into the depths of the crypt. Under heavy defense, it was placed in the same place as the dark soul stone...
