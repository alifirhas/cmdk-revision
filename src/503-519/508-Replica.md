# 508 - Replica

Everyone knows that the new Horadrim Church, like the old Horadrim Church, is an organization formed by powerful mages called by the Archangel Tyrael. Because of Tyrael's existence, this organization is in the shelter The meaning of the land is extraordinary, it represents justice and the hope of the people of Sanctuary.

Humans in Sanctuary are a very hard-working group. On this land, they have experienced too many wars, wars between angels and demons, wars between humans and demons, and wars between humans and humans. The traumatized land is nearing the limit of what it can bear and so is humanity.

But in order to survive, they can only fight with gritted teeth. Under the long-term war, the human beings in this world also have some special qualifications, that is, they can respond extremely quickly when facing a crisis.

Therefore, when the New Horadrim Church sent messengers, the kingdoms of Sanctuary immediately took action. Large cities in the human world, such as Westmarch, Lut Gholein, and Khanduras, have been strengthened in the first place. The defense forces of the city and the beacon towers above the border are also on guard.

They gathered civilians, hoarded war supplies, summoned mercenaries to assist the city defense, and at the same time sent a team of adventurers to go deep into the wasteland ravaged by demons so that they could monitor the movements of the demons.

Under this intensive plan, information from various places was gathered, and the effect soon appeared.

A team of adventurers composed of highly qualified nephalems discovered a strange phenomenon when they probed the edge of the land of fear. The monsters and demons that were originally active in this land did not know Why has the number decreased so much? Even in the process of going deep into the depths of the land of fear, occasionally we can find some fleeing demons. These demons fled from the hinterland of the land of fear in a panic and fled towards the edge.

They seem to be avoiding something terrible...

This phenomenon attracted the attention of the adventurer team. After they discussed it, they decided to investigate.

The former name of the Land of Fear was called the Northern Steppe. This was the former barbarian highland. Due to its proximity to the Arreat Mountains, when the World Stone was destroyed, it was inevitably affected by a large amount of polluted volcanic dust. As the wind drifted here, this land became unsuitable for survival, and the barbarians who once protected this land also left, making this land more and more barren. The name of the land of fear comes from this.

In this case, the land of fear has also become a paradise for demons and monsters. The adventurer team carefully moves on this land, doing their best to avoid the monsters they encounter along the way, but occasionally encounters To the unavoidable situation, we can only bravely break through.

Walking hard all the way, they went straight to the northern end of the land of fear. After arriving here, they suddenly found an empty and dead land.

There are no animals, no beasts, and no plants. Even the rivers flowing are poisonous liquids. Even demons and monsters cannot be seen. There is only a black tower standing on the empty plain, emitting a Breath of death.

"Could it be here? The descending Demon Lord Osiris, is this his hiding place?"

The members of the adventurer team thought so and looked at each other, wondering if they should go to investigate.

The Nephalems in this adventurer team include mages, crusaders, barbarians, witches, even a witch doctor, but there is no necromancer. So in the face of this exudes death They also felt a bit of a headache in the black tower of breath. After all, they were limited in number. If they accidentally disturbed the army of undead that might exist, they might pay a heavy price here.

In the end, it was the mages in the team who detected it and said, "The space here is not disturbed. The portal can be opened here. Let's go. If the situation is really wrong, we can use the portal to escape."

It was this sentence that strengthened the people's determination and made them continue to explore the tower.

However, just three days later, a portal that suddenly appeared in the fortress opened, and the survivors of this adventurer team appeared. The original team of eight adventurers finally escaped and only three people escaped. The wizards, witch doctors and Crusaders of the portal, and the other five were all killed in the black tower.

Even the three people who escaped were also seriously injured. The defenders in the fortress hurriedly treated them and they managed to save their lives.

After waking up, the three surviving talents reported what they had seen and heard to the defenders of the fortress. The black tower was not the hiding place where the Demon King Osiris was entrenched, but a... strange demon habitat!

The appearance of that demon is unlike any of the demons that have previously appeared in Sanctuary. It takes the form of a colossal black octopus, devoid of wings or claws. Instead, it possesses numerous sinewy tentacles that writhe and sway. Its head is adorned with a multitude of scarlet devilish eyes, while an aura of death and a potent blend of elemental powers emanate from its body.

This is a rather terrifying and powerful demon. It not only devours human beings, but also devours demons and monsters. Those demon races that escaped from the land of fear escaped precisely because of the death threat from this demon.

This colossal octopus demon has entrenched itself deep within the confines of the black tower, its sinewy tentacles sprawling throughout the structure. As the adventurer team ventures further into the tower, they find themselves engaged in relentless combat against these formidable appendages. The tentacles possess a remarkable regenerative ability, making them seemingly inexhaustible. The team expends a significant amount of their potion supplies during these encounters. Eventually, they locate the head of the octopus demon, but not without casualties. In the final battle against the demon, the four barbarians and witches in the team are the first to be swallowed whole. With the situation becoming dire, one valiant Crusader soldier elects to stay behind, sacrificing themselves to buy time for the others to escape. Tragically, all five individuals meet their demise within the confines of the tower.

"That's at least a lord-level demon!"

The last surviving Crusader soldier recalled that the heavy armor on his body saved his life, but one of his left arms was torn off by the tentacles of the octopus demon. He stroked the broken wound, With lingering fears, he said "But this is not the point. Although the lord-level demon is powerful, it is not incomprehensible. The point is, we realized at the time that this powerful demon lord was entrenched here, maybe he was guarding something! So We're going all the way to the top of the tower just to figure it out...there we see what the devil is guarding!"

"Kanai's Box! It's a Kanai's Box!" The Crusader said aloud in a tone of amazement, looking at his expression, even he himself couldn't believe what he saw.

"Impossible!" His words really aroused everyone's exclamation, and a Nephalem dressed as a hooded mage said in surprise "Isn't Kanai's box placed in the core hall of the church!? How could it be there!?"

"I also know that Kanai's Box was originally an artifact created by the sages of the Horadrim Church. After being recovered by the heroes, it has been placed by the Church all the time. There are many solid guards outside. Of course, it is impossible for demons to... Steal it?!" The Crusader said, "But... but what we saw in that tower was really like Kanai's Box!"

Everyone knew that this Crusader soldier who devoutly believed in the Holy Light certainly couldn't panic, but they still checked with the other two survivors and learned that they had also seen the thing that was suspected to be Kanai's box. After that, everyone could not help but look solemn.

Kanai's Box is not a secret, at least many Nephalems in Sanctuary know about it. This alchemy item created by the most powerful mages gathered by the sages of the Horadrim Church is considered a Nephalem. A legend that everyone has heard.

However, although Kanai's Cube has powerful power, this power is also very dangerous, so many years ago, the old Horadrim Church did not use it directly, but made a copy of it to use, this The replica is the Horadric Cube, and the authentic Kanai's Box was handed over to the barbarians of Mount Arreat to guard.

The unsealing of Kanai's Cube was after the collapse of the World Stone not long ago. The Nephalems who gradually regained their power retrieved Kanai's Cube and placed it in the newly established Horadrim. Used in the church, in the battle against Diablo, the power of Kanai's box provided the nephalem with many powerful magical equipment, which was the key to the nephalem's victory over Diablo.

This powerful and dangerous alchemical artifact is closely guarded by the new Horadrim, using it both to strengthen the resistance and prevent its power from being abused, so when I heard that Kanai's Cube appeared in the fear When the black tower in the land was still being guarded by a powerful demon, everyone was startled.

The news was urgently sent back to the New Horadrim Church, and the church members quickly contacted Tyrael to confirm and check the situation of Kanai's Cube, which could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.

After relaxing, everyone in the church, including Tyrael, couldn't help but become curious about the black tower in the Land of Fear, because they had never heard of Kanai's Cube and another replica.

So, in this case, a larger Nephalem team was formed, and their task was to go to the black tower again under the leadership of the three survivors, and be sure to kill the octopus Demon, and brought back Kanai's Box (suspected).

The team set off soon, but they didn't know that all their actions were watched by the eyes of the demons hidden in the air...
