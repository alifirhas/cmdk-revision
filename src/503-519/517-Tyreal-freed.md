# 517 - Tyrael Freed

The cold icy wind whistled and the blizzard raged in the depths of the snow-capped mountains in Xiansai. The dense snowflakes and cold air blocked the transmission of light, allowing the depths of the snow-capped mountains to maintain polar visibility for many years, minus seventy to eighty degrees below zero. The climate has made this place a restricted area for mortals. Only those ice and snow monsters who live here can move freely here.

On the top of the highest mountain in the depths of the snow-capped mountains, a dark hole was so abrupt against the backdrop of the white snow that even a blizzard couldn't cover the hole, because a gray mist always shrouded it.

If someone can enter the cave through the fog, and then go deeper into the cave for about a kilometer, they will find that there is a cave inside. A black hall of nearly 10,000 square meters is built in the cave, and various Gothic-style sculptures stand. Here, the stars surround a huge throne made of black ice crystals.

However, at this moment, there is no one on the black ice throne...

Going beyond the main hall and entering the deeper part of the cave, there are several passages extending out, and the passage in the middle is connected to a not-so-wide secret room.

In the middle of the secret room, a huge demon's claw, also formed of black ice, rose from the ground and grasped towards the sky. Above the demon's claw, a fist-sized crystal floated and turned slowly.

Inside the crystal, a golden streamer can be seen rushing left and right. Every time it collides with the crystal wall, it will immediately turn to the other side.

This is called the "Bright Soul Stone", the crystal stone that imprisoned Archangel Tyrael's soul...

As a soul imprisoned in the crystal, Tyrael has already lost his sense of time, and he does not know how long he has been in the crystal, only that since the demon king Osiris put him here and ignored him, he has hit the crystal wall more than 150 million times in a row!

He didn't dare to let his soul fall asleep in the crystal, so he could only use this method to reluctantly calculate how long he had been imprisoned. However, as the count continued to increase, Tyrael's anxiety became stronger and stronger.

He didn't know what the outside world was like, whether the Demon King Osiris made a move against Sanctuary, or what the current situation of the High Heavens was, whether the Angiris Council was still holding on, the more time passed, the more in Tyrael's  anxiety becomes stronger.

Even for a certain period of time, Tyrael actually understood the mood of Mephisto Diablo and his seven demon kings being imprisoned in the dark soul stone. This long, this loneliness, this powerlessness is enough to make any creature feel in the heart. anger continued to rise.

Tyrael has sworn that when he gets out of trouble, he will take back the shame of his imprisonment from Osiris! Let him feel the wrath from the Archangel!

It just hit and hit like this. Suddenly, Tyrael found that one side of the crystal wall seemed to be weaker. He didn't know if it was his own illusion, but with hope in his heart, he immediately cheered up. Again and again, I kept hitting the point I just felt.

He himself doesn't know whether this kind of collision can really get him out of trouble, but apart from this, he can't do anything else. Although the crystal stone can make him sound the voice of the soul, this is the Demon King Osiris. In the hall, no one will pay attention to him,  hear his voice, or there will be no warriors in some knight novels to liberate his soul.

Just like this, Tyrael found that the obstacles to him from the crystal wall were getting smaller and smaller. After he didn't even remember how many times he hit, suddenly, Tyrael found that his eyes were bright, and the original was unchanged. The crystal wall picture was replaced by a new picture.

"Out... out!?" Tyrael looked at the narrow secret room around him in disbelief and then condensed his body again ecstatically.

The Archangel was originally a creature composed of holy light. They had no flesh and blood at all. It was a matter of hand to transform the body from the soul. After a flash of light, Tyrael's face was exactly the same as Uldyssian.

Uldyssian, the most powerful Nephalem in history, left a deep impression on Tyrael. The archangel was originally faceless, and the armor he usually wore was only a pure mass It was only the Holy Light, but after Tyrael fell to Sanctuary and became a mortal, his condensed face subconsciously chose the exact same face as Uldyssian.

The Archangel Tyrael, who wore the face of Uldyssian, broke out of the Bright Soul Stone and stumbled to the ground.

The constant impact in the crystal has weakened his soul power a lot, so after turning into a fleshly body, it is accompanied by an extremely strong headache and dizziness.

Tyrael didn't dare to stay here for a long time when he found that his power was greatly reduced, for fear that the Demon King Osiris would find his escape and suddenly appear.

Forcing the discomfort and the double image in front of him, Tyrael stumbled out of the secret room, but only half a minute later, he turned back from the passage.

Bowing his head, Tyrael looked at the Bright Soul Stone with a complicated look. This crystal returned to its original shape after he got out of trouble. It looked like an ordinary crystal, and it continued to float on the demon's claw.

After suffering a loss in the hands of Osiris, Tyrael has also thought a lot during this time. He is now an archangel who inherited the name of Malthael's wisdom. When he understands a little about what kind of demon the enemy is Later, he also realized that he underestimated the enemy.

Now that he has calmed down again, he realizes that something is wrong, and his escape from trouble was a bit unexpected. If it wasn't for the fact that the Bright Soul Stone was really flawed, then it was certain that his escape should have been designed by the Demon King Osiris, and he would Free yourself!

So, why did he release himself? It's impossible to be confident enough in your own strength to deliberately add an archangel-level opponent to yourself, right?

"This is a conspiracy!" Tyrael understood, looked at the bright soul stone and said "Osiris's purpose is a High Heaven, but the High Heaven is in the purgatory space, he is an alien demon, there is no way he has The spatial coordinates of the High Heaven, so naturally it is impossible to directly tear open the space channel and invade the High Heaven like Diablo... He let me out because he knew that I must go back to the High Heaven. He wanted to track me, Find the location of the High Heaven..."

Tyrael looked at the bright soul stone in front of him with a complicated look, stretched out his hand, wanted to grab the soul stone, but then let go, and repeated this several times.

He muttered to himself "This soul stone has the function of a beacon, if I take it away, it will inevitably reveal the coordinates of the High Heaven, but if I don't take it away, this soul stone will become all angels A nightmare! Together with the war, the angel warriors who are killed will be imprisoned by the soul stone and will never be able to return..."

Tyrael closed his eyes, raised his head towards the top of the secret room, and felt extremely tangled in his heart, but after a while, Tyrael opened his eyes, stretched out his right hand, and grabbed the Soul Stone in his hand.

After some ideological struggle, Tyrael's eyes were full of determination at this moment, he held the soul stone in his right hand, as if explaining, and as if to comfort himself "Even if I don't take the soul stone, Osiris still have other ways to find the way to the High Heaven. I just delayed his plan, but I'll take the soul stone, and our warriors will return in the war!"

As soon as he turned around, Tyrael resolutely walked into the passage, bringing the soul stone with him.

Sure enough, when Tyrael came to the Demon King's Palace, he found that there was no one here, and the Demon King Osiris had long since disappeared, as if he had created conditions for him to escape.

Tyrael had both flukes and sighs in his heart. Luckily, he escaped no matter what, and sighed that he knew that this was Osiris's conspiracy, but he had to follow Osiris's routine. .

"Such an artifact soul stone, it shouldn't be easy to make one. Osiris won't have a second one. I will bring it back to the High Heaven and place it in the deepest part of heaven!" As he walked outside, he thought to himself, "Unless you break through the interception of our four archangels, don't even think about taking this soul stone back, Osiris!"

Leaving the Devil's Palace, Tyrael walked into the snowy mountains. The cruel natural environment did not have much impact on him, but he did not dare to show his angelic attitude and fly, for fear of disturbing the monsters in the snowy mountains. So he could only travel long distances and walk out of the snowy mountains on his own legs.

About half a month later, Tyrael finally walked out of the snowy mountain. When he saw the cities built on the mountain wall below on the cliff, he realized where he was.

"This is Xiansai..." Looking at the unique oriental charm of the city buildings, Tyrael felt a lot more relaxed. He planned to go to these human cities to find out how much time has passed, and by the way, to ask how Sanctuary is now How's it going.

However, when he came to the city, he found that there were not only the original oriental Xiansai people in the city, but also many western-looking [2] Caldeum people.

Tyrael was very surprised by this. He knew that the place of Xiansai was almost isolated from the world, and the frozen sea was not so easy to cross. So where did these Caldeum people come from?

And along with his observation, he found that these Caldeum peoples seemed to be refugees. They looked hungry and yellow, their eyes were sunken, and their clothes were tattered. They have been rescued, but refugees still rob locals from time to time in the city.

This situation has attracted many complaints from the locals of Xiansai. Tyrael has heard the whispers of Xiansai people in his ears. He is planning to unite and expel these refugees to live outside the city. They only Some sympathy has already been exhausted by these refugees who keep coming...

"What happened?" Tyrael looked confused. Fortunately, he saw a familiar face in the refugee group at this time. It was a down-and-out man. Where was Tyrael before? seen him.

He walked up to the man, reached out and grabbed his collar, and said, "You are a resident of Westmarch City? Why are you here!?"

However, what Tyrael didn't expect was that after recognizing Tyrael, the man broke away Tyrael's hand in a panic and landed on the ground, rubbing his legs desperately and stepping backwards. He shouted hysterically "Angel! Here comes the angel! The angel hits the fairy!"

Alarmed by the man's shouting, there was a commotion in the surrounding crowd, and Tyrael's position was instantly emptied. The refugees who escaped were hiding behind various buildings, revealing a One eye looked carefully at Tyrael.

After finding that Tyrael seemed to be alone, the refugees had a little courage. They held the weapons they could find and slowly surrounded them. In their eyes, there was a kind of 'hatred'. of light!

"Tell me, what happened!?" Tyrael also saw that something was wrong with the refugees, but he still tried to ask, hoping that someone would tell him.

It turned out to be the man from Westmarch just now, who trembled and shouted at Tyrael: "It's you angels! Back then, Malthael's army of soul-reavers destroyed Westmarch and us. Our home! Now that the city has just been rebuilt, you are here again! You are no different from those demons, and you all want to destroy us!"

"Get out!

"Damn angel, get out of Xiansai!"

"You are not welcome here!"

A large number of stones, rotten eggs, rotten vegetables, and kitchen knives and iron rods flew in a mess and smashed on Tyrael's body. The dignified archangel could only avoid these humiliations in embarrassment at this moment.

At this time, Tyrael may be able to scare off these mortals as long as he shows his sword or unfolds his wings of light, but Tyrael knows that he cannot do this. From the words of these refugees, he heard Out, the army of heaven may have invaded the world of Sanctuary again!

In other words, his unease has come true, and the plan of the Demon King Osiris has succeeded...

So, he ignored these mortals shouting and killing him, spread his wings, and Tyrael slammed into the sky.

Hearing the loud cheers from the refugees on the ground, Tyrael felt as if he was being scorched by fire. The mortals he had always wanted to protect turned his head and hated him. The sourness in it, Only Tyrael can understand...
