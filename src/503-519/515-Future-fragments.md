# 515 - Future Fragments

To be honest, Roy was really taken aback when he heard Mephisto mention the word 'Star Soul Titan'.Because the first character that popped up in his mind was Sargeras.

If this Trag'Oul, which Mephisto calls the Star Soul Titan, is really a Titan on the same level as Sargeras, then it will be really troublesome.

But then Roy reacted and asked suspiciously, "Mephisto, do you also know the 'Star Soul Titan'?"

Yes, this is where Roy finds it strange. After all, the name Star Soul Titan should be called by the world of Azeroth, and other worlds should not be called this way. Is Mephisto going? Been to the world of Azeroth?

"Of course!" Mephisto gave a strange smile and bowed slightly to Roy "Young Demon King Osiris, the one in front of you now is one of the oldest demons in the abyss world. My experience, It's wider than you think."

Roy nodded. This is true. When he was still in the abyss world, Benia once told Roy that Mephisto should be the first big devil to appear after Lucifer and the other seven original sin devils. In other words, his existence history is second only to Lucifer Beelzebub and them.

"In fact, you may not understand that the word Star Soul Titan was originally named by demons!" Mephisto continued "Because of their nature, demons are more willing to explore the world than angels. Random teleportation, in some unknown worlds, the demons are often the first to arrive, and the angels are the ones chasing the demons! It gave birth to a powerful planetary consciousness. When these planetary consciousnesses wake up, they often turn into giant and tyrannical beings, so they are called Star Soul Titans. These Star Soul Titans seem to be created by the Creator except angels and demons. The third son of creation, they are the real Titans, they have even more power than angels and demons, so ordinary demons rarely provoke them..."

"Fortunately, the number of star-soul titans is even rarer than expected. In the [2] Wanjie universe connected to the gate of the abyss, there are few traces of star-soul titans, but the giants living on the surface. There are many worlds, and although these giants are also called Titans, their power is nothing compared to the real Titans."

"Sanctuary will give birth to a star-soul titan, which we did not expect at all!" Mephisto said with a sigh "This is obviously just a man-made world and the history of existence is also very short, but there is a Star Soul Titan, this is unexpected! So at the beginning, we didn't think about this aspect, but after our observation, we found that this guy really exists like Star Soul Titan!"

"Like? So, you are not sure?" Roy asked.

"Yes, Trag'Oul, she is hiding in a gap between Sanctuary and Purgatory. This gap seems to have been created by her. Unless she wants to, no one can get there. Then Over the years, she has rarely appeared in the world, and she has been hiding very well!" Mephisto said with some hatred "This guy claims to be the guardian of the Sanctuary, when Inarius and Lilith created the In the world of Sanctuary, the Sanctuary was hidden from the High Heaven and the Hell of Flames. After Lilith and Inarius turned against each other and were exiled, Sanctuary was almost exposed to heaven and hell, but Trag'Oul actually took action at this time, wrapped her body around the world of Sanctuary, and continued to hide it! So much so that by the time we discovered the existence of Sanctuary, the world had existed for a long time..."

"...Well, it was mentioned in Rathma's book that Trag'Oul is a long dragon formed by connecting stars. Will the Star Soul Titan also incarnate in this shape?" Roy asked thoughtfully.

"Don't you think that the Star Soul Titans are all human-shaped?" Mephisto asked Roy funny, and then said: "The meaning of 'Titan' refers to the incomparably huge size, and the Star Soul Titan can be any shape. !"

Hearing this, Roy suddenly thought about it, thinking of Urgash and Asha in the Ashan world. These two dragon gods are dragons that are huge enough to entangle the entire planet, so are they also star soul titans? After all, they all have the power to create the world, which is very similar to the Star Soul Titan.

If it is, then the world of Ashan is really special. Asha and Urgash are like two star-soul titans born on the same planet at the same time. They belong to the twins of the star-soul titan... Pantheon is ecstatic.

It's a pity that Roy is only guessing now. Urgash has become the lord of the void, and the world of Asha has been completely swallowed up by the power of the void. It is already impossible to study everything in that world.

Looking at Roy's appearance, Mephisto thought he was worried that the power of the Star Soul Titan would hinder him, so he said "But you don't have to care too much about Trag'Oul existence. Although the Ona guy may be a star soul titan, he doesn't seem to wake up completely!"

"Oh? Why do you say that?" Roy asked.

"The true awakening of the Star-Soul Titan will manifest a tangible form in the material word!" Mephisto exclaimed. "In the Book of Rathma, the necromancers' depictions of Trag'Oul, in my estimation, lack the telltale signs of complete awakening. Otherwise, she would not be described as a 'dragon composed of stars.' It is my belief that she remains in an ethereal state, hindered by inherent deficiencies within her star-soul nature. Her slumber has been too brief, and as a star-soul titan, she faces inherent limitations... I suspect this is the true reason why she cannot reveal herself to the world—it is not that she lacks the desire, but rather, she lacks the capability!"

"Well, indeed, it sounds like she is also deliberately avoiding angels and demons!" Roy nodded in agreement "You can also see some clues from her desperate attempts to hide the Sanctuary."

"So you don't have to worry too much about her, this guy is a magic stick!" Mephisto sneered "She is full of rhetoric about guarding the balance, including those necromancers who believe in her, who believe in guarding the balance. , but in my opinion, this teaching is not only a rhetoric of Trag'Oul's own existence, but also a manifestation of her guilty conscience, because both angels and demons have the idea of ​​destroying Sanctuary, and Sanctuary is her, once destroyed, it means that Trag'Oul can no longer survive..."

"Understood, so she keeps promoting the concept of balance, just to keep the eternal battle between angels and demons going!" Roy nodded "If she fights for tens of thousands of years, she will be able to escape from the Sanctuary. This planet has completely grown up, then she will be afraid of no one."

"That's it!" Mephisto also nodded in agreement "In order to achieve her goal, this guy will do whatever it takes. She used the son of Inarius and Lilith, Linarian! That is the first generation, or The first nephalem in Sanctuary! Jie Jie Jie, this poor child, he had a terrible relationship with his parents because his mother Lilith slaughtered the renegade angels and demons just to force Inarius to give up The idea of ​​domination over the human race allows her to use the power of the Nephalem as a weapon for her own benefit."

"When Linarian was at a loss, Trag'Oul found him, the professor gave him the knowledge of death, made Linarian the first necromancer in this world, and bewitched him that the Nephalem should be independent You can do it by living your life without depending on angels or demons, just by believing in the way of balance."

"Linarian believed him and no longer recognized himself as the son of Inarius and Lilith, he even changed his name and called himself Rathma... But it is ridiculous that, because of the power of practising death, Rathma and his followers all turned pale, and the Necromancers became very different from the other Nephalems. They could not live among ordinary people, because the other Nephalems always looked at them with distrust. They! Their way of balance is only spread in a small area."

Roy took over the conversation and said, "Unfortunately, because of the existence of demons, although the Nephalem people hate these necromancers, they still accept necromancers in order to fight against demons, don't they?"

"That's true, so Osiris, this is also a breakthrough!" Mephisto smiled strangely "If it is possible, I really want to see necromancers and their compatriots fight in fighting. although they always fight infighting, but the Necromancer is a believer of Trag'Oul. Once this heritage declines, Trag'Oul's existence will be even more unknown."

"I understand!" Roy nodded and the exchange with Mephisto made him realize that although he needs to be alert to the existence of Trag'Oul, he doesn't need to imagine her too much. She is the only one in the material world. The spokesperson is only the necromancer family. Maybe she will disrupt the situation, but it is estimated that it will not cause too much trouble.

"That's right, compared to Trag'Oul, I think what you really need to worry about is Lilith!" Mephisto said with a cautious look "This is the second thing I want to say, from the long river of time, I have seen some fragmented fragments of the future, and in these fragments, Lilith has returned!"

"Wait, wait!" Roy waved his hand and said, "Among the many legends in this world, isn't it said that Lilith is your daughter? Are you a father, are you still afraid of your daughter?"

As a result, Mephisto's ugly monster's face showed a white-eyed look, and said "Damn Osiris, how can you believe these legends of human beings? Who told you that Lilith is my daughter? I didn't. With such a great ability, how can i be Lilith's father! In other words, apart from the Creator, no one dares to be Lilith's elder!"

After finishing speaking, Mephisto also explained: "At the beginning, I just brought Lilith to this world and what I brought was only a clone of her. She came to this world and asked for it, because she need a test site"

"Experiment for what?" Roy asked with a frown.

"Who knows?" Mephisto spread his hands and said "She is always mysterious, how can I know what she wants? Originally after she and Inarius married and gave birth to Nephalem, Me and My brother always thought that her experiment was to create a mixed race of angels and demons. After all, she is a female demon and has the need to breed offspring. Although this need is a bit different, it is not too bizarre, but later we found that even if Nephalem, not what she really wanted."

"How do you say?" Hearing this, Roy's heart suddenly moved, and he hurriedly continued to ask.

"After the creation of Nephalem, Lilith really cared for them at the beginning and even to protect her children, she did not hesitate to destroy all the angels and demons who were hiding in the Sanctuary at that time. It is precisely because of this, she will turn against Inarius... The dispute between the two was just a quarrel from the beginning, but it didn't take long for it to turn into a fight. Because he was in control of the World Stone, Inarius exiled Lilith - attention, yes Banished! Instead of defeating, because Inarius can't actually beat Lilith, her power is beyond everyone's imagination, even if she is just a clone..."

"But there is also a saying that the reason why Inarius and Lilith are really against their goals is because Lilith threatens Inarius' rule, because Lilith actually wants to use the power of Nephalem, and Inarius thinks that she is the refuge The true king of the land!"

Mephisto concluded "No matter what the reason is, it can be said that the Nephalem is not what Lilith really wants. The real purpose of her coming to this world is probably more than that. This mysterious woman It hides a secret that even we can't see through..."

Hearing this, Roy never spoke, but he had already made a judgment in his heart.

What Lilith is after may indeed not be Nephalem, who is a hybrid of angels and demons, but is searching for the power of chaos!

The simple mixture of light and darkness is not the power of chaos. This is something that Roy can be absolutely sure of, but he made a judgment based on his own experience and many cognition. For Lilith, who can only explore step by step from scratch. As far as the concerned, she must not know.

So the Nephalem might just be an attempt by her, which can also explain why Lilith loved the Nephalem more at the beginning, because she had expectations for the Nephalem, but maybe it was later that she found out about the Nephalem. After Nephalem can't bear her expectation, she will gradually become only wanting to use the power of Nephalem, which is a kind of psychological transformation from "own child" to "tool person".

In other words, Lilith's experiment in this world failed.

As far as Roy knows, Lilith has clones in many worlds, and these clones are doing the same thing, at least in the Darksiders World, the Lilith that Roy met is the same, but in the Darksiders World, she The experiment was done with the corpses of angels and demons (here can be regarded as genetic experiments), and did not choose to have children with an angel, so the Nephilim (Nephalem) in the Darksiders World just regarded Lilith as a nominal mother.

Roy had a clear understanding in his heart and he roughly guessed Lilith's real purpose. What she needed was a powerful force, which was enough for her to deal with the threat of void erosion.

So, what does she want to do to fight against the erosion of the void? It can't be to save the world, right?

So Roy has another bold guess: Lilith, she may want to go to the depths of the void to find something...

Connecting with the original sin demon kings who are also in the abyss world, Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Baal, they all seem to only have a few scattered clones left, and the real body has already disappeared, so Has their body also gone to the depths of the void as Roy had guessed?

Or, because of the lack of power to fight against the void, it has already fallen into it? So Lilith has to learn their lessons and find a way to fight the void?

Roy's thinking was a little messed up, so he quickly drove out these inexplicable thoughts. No matter whether his guess was correct or not, these thoughts interfered too much with him.

Looking back, Roy asked Mephisto "Can you see the future fragments from the long river of time?"

"I can see some, but I can't see the causal connection before and after! Otherwise, how could my brother and I suffer such a big loss in this world?" Mephisto admitted bluntly "It's the same this time. I saw Lilith's return from a future clip."

"You asked me to be careful of her because she would attack angels and demons when she came back?" Roy asked with a frown.

"That's absolutely, she wiped out all the demons in the entire Sanctuary!" Mephisto said with certainty "So it's hard to guarantee that after her return this time, she will also take action against demons like us. You know, this Women don't have any concept of race!"

"After all this, I should leave too! Young Demon King Osiris, my brother and I will regain our strength soon, and then we will fight side by side with you to completely destroy the High Heaven and kill this place. All angels! The eternal battle of this world will finally end in your hands, and I guarantee that your bravery will be sung throughout the abyss world..."

As he spoke, Mephisto's figure slowly sank down, and finally completely disappeared in the hall.

Roy watched him leave the whole time. After Mephisto's figure completely disappeared, Roy grabbed the demon's claw in his right hand. Under the powerful force, the air made a huge explosion in his palm. Roy's entire complexion completely collapsed.

"Damn old devil, he still didn't tell the truth in the end!" Roy snorted coldly in his heart.

Mephisto, the bastard, said nine points of truth and one point of falsehood. Roy was sure that what he said before about Trag'Oul and Lilith's return was true, but he concealed one thing, that's the power after Lilith's return!

Mephisto is afraid of Lilith, otherwise he will not let Roy be careful of Lilith. That is to say, he not only sees Lilith's return in future clips, but also may see Lilith's powerful power. Take a bold guess, Mephisto even saw the picture of himself dying at the hands of Lilith!

As a demon who has been in contact with the power of the void several times, Roy does not believe that Lilith will return safe and sound after being exiled to the void...

Her avatar, like the original Urgash, may have been eroded by the power of the void!

Perhaps it is because of this that Lilith becomes unstoppable, and Mephisto may have seen Roy's figure in the future clips. This is how he really came forward and invited Roy to come to this sanctuary. The real reason for the world!

He either wanted Roy to resolve this disaster that might involve the Seven Demon Kings, or he wanted Roy to be a shield! You must know that the seven demon kings are now hidden in the Burning Hell, and there is only a demon king like Roy in the sheltered land. After Lilith returns, she will definitely vent her anger from being exiled for many years. Whether it is an angel or a demon, she is the target of venting. And Roy, the only demon king on the earth, is the best shield of the flaming hell!

"You think you can deceive me? It won't be so simple!" Roy sneered. Mephisto may be unaware that Roy is in a different world, but Roy has encountered other avatar of Lilith. There exists a peculiar connection, an inexplicable bond between Roy and Lilith that Mephisto cannot fathom!

If Lilith's avatar and her avatar share memory and thinking like Mephisto, then Lilith, who has returned, will understand immediately after seeing Roy.

Of course, Roy's current appearance has already changed, but it doesn't matter, the egg of the Red Sea he brought is the biggest token!

"Come on, now I wish Lilith came back early, just in time for the biggest banquet between angels, demons and humans!"

The boundless darkness filled the entire Demon King's Palace, Roy's power was exuding recklessly. In this lightless world, only his pair of bright red eye were left, shining a strong light in the darkness...
