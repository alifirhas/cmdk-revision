# 519 - Prophecy

Feeling the trembling of the Bright Soul Stone in his hand, Tyrael flew quickly to the Diamond Gate.

In the sea of ​​clouds outside the Diamond Gate, Tyrael put down the Bright Soul Stone and took a few steps back.

The location he chose is called the Sea of ​​Clouds Plain. Although it is the Sea of ​​Clouds, it is actually the foundation below, which is the extension of the foundation of the entire Silver City. However, due to the particularity of the space where the high-order heaven is located, this piece of land has been tumbling and growing. The clouds and mists are endless throughout the year, so it looks like clouds here.

For thousands of years, the demon army of the abyss of Flames has invaded the High Heaven several times. It was used by the army when the High Heaven invaded abyss. Anyway, during the whole process of the eternal battle, the demons fought the High Heaven, and the angels also fought the flame abyss.

In fact, whether it is Tyrael or Imperius, when they know that the demon army is about to attack the High Heaven, they are not too anxious in their hearts, because they are already familiar with this set of offensive and defensive processes.

The angel army of the entire silver city is being mobilized in an orderly manner, but due to the previous attack on the Sanctuary, there are still many angel troops that have not been transferred back. Tt is not Mephisto who came to attack the silver city this time, neither the seven old-fashioned demon kings, is a strange demon king, making the angels are still a little uncertain about what the other party will do.

During the waiting time, Tyrael had already unfolded his light wings and put on his archangel armor. He also held the sword of justice, the brilliance of the holy feather, just after he finished During these preparations, three golden streamers suddenly descended from the sky and landed behind him.

These three golden streams of light were Imperius, and Auriel and Itherael who had arrived after the news. They slowly stood up and walked towards Tyrael.

The wing of light behind the Archangel of Courage Imperius looks as red as a flame. This wing of flame is just like Imperius' character, with a fiery temper and high fighting spirit. As for the Archangel Auriel of Hope, the light wings behind her flowed a faint blue, like gentle flowing water. As for the Archangel of Destiny, Itherael, behind him is a light wing filled with a purple halo, just like destiny, mysterious and incomprehensible.

Coupled with the pure white light wings behind Tyrael, which symbolize justice, it can be said that the four archangels have their own characteristics. The color of the wings is merely a symbol of the strength of their respective duties and authority.

Whether it's Imperius, Auriel, or Itherael, what they are shrouded under the visor and hood is just a ray of light, without any face or expression at all, which sets off Tyrael's appearance It's an alternative, but fortunately the angels don't care about it. After coming to stand beside Tyrael, the four archangels all looked at the bright soul stone not far away.

"Is this the sphere that can seal the soul of the archangel?" Auriel asked curiously. Her voice sounded so gentle, like a harmonious movement, unforgettable.

Tyrael nodded and said "Yes, if my guess is correct, the trembling of the sphere is that the devil Osiris is trying to contact this sphere, and Osiris will use it as a beacon to open the portal directly enter High Heaven."

"This sphere can no longer fall into the hands of any demons!" Imperius snorted coldly "If the Demon King Osiris wants to open the gate of abyss to summon demons, it will be wishful thinking! After he appears, we will kill him first, without giving him any chance to open the gate of abyss. After defeating him, they will recover the sphere and try to erase the space-time beacon on it. In this way, the next time the demon will stop trying to use it for teleportation."

"This is exactly why I brought it back!" Tyrael nodded and said solemnly "Osiris set up a conspiracy for me, so that I had to expose the location of the High Heaven to him, but as long as By defeating him with absolute power, we can break this conspiracy!"

Auriel also nodded and said: "Fortunately, ordinary low-level demons can't open the portal in the space where the High Heaven is located, and the seven demon kings are still recovering their power, so we are only Just need to guard against Osiris..."

Imperius looked at Itherael, who had not spoken, and asked, "Has your destiny scroll displayed any content?"

Itherael didn't speak, just raised his hands, and then a huge scroll filled with golden light emerged between his hands, Itherael gently opened his hands, and the golden scroll followed Open slowly.

On the page of the scroll, lines of text appeared quietly.

> *When the end comes, wisdom will be lost, And justice will fall to earth* <br>
> *Bravery burns into rage—* <br>
> *And all hope will be swallowed up by despair* <br>
> *At last, death will spread its wings and cover the sun—* <br>
> *Fate was torn to shreds forever* <br>

All the four archangels saw this passage of text, but unlike Imperius and the others who were confused about the text, Tyrael exclaimed in exclamation after seeing this passage "This... this is Kai. The contents of the Book of Grace!?"

"The Book of Cane? The Book of Mortals?" Imperius's voice sounded a little displeased.

"Yes, I remember!" Tyrael's dark face was deeply wrinkled, and he said "This is a book written by a great wise man among the human beings in Sanctuary. During the time when I fell into the world, I even witnessed his death with my own eyes. I have also read the books he left behind, so I was very impressed. This passage is what he left at the beginning of the book... similar to Prophecy."

"Prophecy? Is he a prophet among mortals?" Auriel asked.

"No... I don't know if he is..." Tyrael shook his head and said, "But I believe that he may have actually seen some... future clips."

Hearing this, Itherael finally spoke. It seemed that because he seldom spoke for a long time, Itherael's voice sounded a little hoarse, and he said "In my scroll, the fate of mortals in Sanctuary has never appeared, because these mortals are not natural creations, but this text has been displayed on the scroll of fate since this time..."

"What do you mean?" Imperius couldn't understand.

"I can't see the fate of mortals, but mortals may be able to see their own fate..." Itherael explained "Perhaps the scroll of fate is using the help of mortals to show us something..."

Hearing these words from Itherael, the four archangels could not help but be silent for a while.

This passage on the Fate Scroll looks a bit vague at first glance. If it was put decades ago, it would not have understood its meaning at all. After the events fall of the angel of death, the four archangels can find the corresponding mapping from this text.

Justice will fall to the mortal world, which should refer to the incident in which Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice, self-destructed his wings and fell into the Sanctuary to become a human being.

Death will spread its wings, covering the sky and the sun, referring to the fallen angel of death, Malthael.

As for heroically turning the raging flames into anger, it should be Imperius. He gathered the power of the Seven Demon Kings in Diablo and entered the High Heaven. Imperius was indeed defeated that time. With his extremely proud personality, this naturally became his most humiliating failure. Whenever he thought of the almost contaminated crystal arch at that time, Imperius was extremely angry in his heart, and even Auriel was always worried about Imperius. Will this negative emotion and eventually go to some extreme?

"So, it's my turn and Itherael's next?" Auriel gazed at the text inscribed on the scroll and contemplated, "Hope will succumb to despair and destiny will be irrevocably shattered... So, am I to be consumed by a form of 'desperation'?"

Tyrael took over the conversation and said, "So, who is Despair..."

Involuntarily, everyone thought of the upcoming Demon King Osiris. Could this 'despair' be him?

Without waiting for everyone to understand, suddenly, the bright soul stone placed on the ground stopped shaking and slowly floated in mid-air. Seeing this scene, Tyrael's head froze and shouted "He's arrive!"

An upright black silk thread suddenly appeared above the sphere. The black silk thread quickly extended towards both ends, became several meters in length and stopped, but then the silk thread began to thicken and began to grow to the left and right sides. It turned into a black fissure, the four archangels saw a pair of demon claws glowing with metallic light sticking out from the fissure.

The owner of the devil's claws is naturally the Demon King Osiris. Tyrael can be sure of this, because he has seen Roy and remembers what Roy's hands look like. He knows that the Demon King Osiris is using his own strength to forcibly tear open this space rift, trying to turn it into a passable portal.

With Roy's strong tearing, the leaked space power began to affect the surrounding environment, and a large number of fine lightnings appeared around the cracks, bursting with strong rays of light.

The fissure has been expanding, and the light has become more and more dazzling. Tyrael, who has a mortal body, couldn't help covering his eyes with his hands, and then only heard a loud bang, and a circle of light waves centered on the fissure. Suddenly it spread out, and the crack was completely torn apart!

Floating in mid-air, Roy stretched out his arms to support the edges of the crack. With the support of his constant magic, the dark crack finally stabilized and eventually turned into a vortex-like portal.

It was not until this time that Roy retracted his arms and drilled out of the portal completely. He landed on the ground with a thud, causing the ground to tremble for a while. This action also caused his entire body to squat slightly.

Under the eyes of the four archangels, he slowly straightened up, and the pair of huge reverse wings behind him also stretched out, and his body was filled with mist, and it appeared to be one body in the clouds and mist of the plain.

Raising his head, the first thing Roy saw was the huge city in the distance. The golden holy light was like the sun, falling from the gaps in the clouds and shining on the city, making the whole city glow. This beautiful picture, even Roy couldn't help but let out a sigh of praise.

“What a great place…”

"Osiris!"

After Tyrael saw Roy, the brilliance of the holy feather in his hand lifted up and pointed at Roy "You really dare to come!"

Roy grinned wickedly and said "Why don't you dare to come? You know, I'm here to chase an angel thief who stole my stuff! Archangel Tyrael, I didn't expect you angels to do this kind of thing"
