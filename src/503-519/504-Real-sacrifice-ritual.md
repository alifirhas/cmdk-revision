# 504 - Real sacrifice ritual

About ten days later, the news reached the New Horadrim Church.

In a secluded room, Archangel Tyrael, who was transformed into a human image, was looking at several pieces of information on the table in front of him with the light of candlelight.

In fact, it is not just Kyle who encountered the remnants of the Zakarum Order in the small town. There are also several similar sacrifices that have occurred in the sanctuary around the world. The demon hunters under the Church of Horadrim, After encountering these incidents, they discovered the seriousness for the first time, so they sent information back to the church. The information in front of Tyrael was all reports of similar events, so every time you browsed a copy, Tyrael His face became serious.

As an archangel who has regained his memories, Tyrael possesses an extensive recollection of the past. He is acutely aware of the true nature of the Zakarum Church. Initially, the Zakarum Church represented the embodiment of light and justice. However, due to the imprisonment of the soul stone containing Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, the church eventually succumbed to temptation and corruption. Nearly the entirety of the church fell under the influence of darkness, transforming into minions and servants of Mephisto. Present-day Zakarum can no longer be recognized as the church that once produced Paladins. In the Sanctuary, the Zakarum cultists have become synonymous with the Dark Order.

It is precisely because he knows that the master of the Zakarum Church is Mephisto, the king of hatred, that Tyrael pays such attention to him. He knows very well that the sudden activity of the Zakarum Church may be Mephisto. Another conspiracy by Mephisto.

Just a few years ago, Diablo, the Lord of Terror, managed to amass the power of the Seven Great Evils and successfully breached the defenses, infiltrating the High Heavens. Even the mighty Archangels of the Angles Council found themselves incapable of withstanding Diablo's onslaught. It was Tyrael who ultimately emerged as the savior, defeating Diablo and sealing him within the Dark Soulstone with the aid of the Nephalem's power. However, when the Radiant Brotherhood believed that Diablo had been securely contained within the dark soulstone, Malthael, who had fallen and embraced his role as the Angel of Death, unexpectedly appeared and forcefully snatched Diablo's soulstone from their grasp.

The most embarrassing thing is that after taking Diablo's soul stone, the archangel Malthael swallowed the soul stone and became extremely powerful with the help of the power of the demon kings.

As a last resort, Tyrael could only use nephalem's power again to enter the Chaos Fortress and fought a battle with Malthael. In the end, he triumphed and defeated Malthael.

Malthael fell from the Chaos Fortress, but in the process of his fall, the soul of Diablo that had been swallowed escaped with it. It was not until this time that Tyrael knew that Malthael actually Did not fully integrate the power of Diablo and the Seven Demon Kings.

From that moment on, Tyrael understood that the Seven Demon Kings might return again. They have immortal souls, and they will be resurrected again and again as they did during the Eternal War, and then bring suffering to this world again.

"Is Mephisto, King of Hatred, who returned first?" Tyrael muttered to himself, looking at the information in front of him with a headache, "He is instructing the Zakarum to call him back?"

But...it seems something is wrong... Tyrael carefully read the description in the information again. If Mephisto wants to return with the sacrifice ceremony, how could the ceremony fail? You should know that although the souls of the demon kings are immortal, it takes a long time to cultivate after each severe damage and fall. Now it has only been a few years since the fall of Malthael, Mephisto's soul is restored. In this state, the scale of the sacrifice ceremony does not need to be too large. In fact, his soul can be recalled from the chaos realm. Then why are the rituals mentioned in these intelligences End of failure?

When Tyrael felt puzzled, another piece of new information was sent over. Tyrael took a look and found that it was another report of a member of the Horadrim Brotherhood who frustrated the sacrifice ceremony. The difference between the report is that the reporter actually recorded the scene with a photo-taking stone and sent it together.

Through this picture stone, Tyrael finally saw the scene of the scene. As a upper rank archangel, he is naturally proficient in various demonic languages ​​and characters. After he carefully identified the magic circle in the picture, gradually His face became more and more surprised.

"Holy light is on! This...this ritual wants to summon, it is not Mephisto, King of Hatred!?" Tyrael's eyes widened "It's...but a demon outside the territory!?"

"Come on! Come on!" Now Tyrael was finally anxious, and hurriedly shouted. After an attendant from the Horadrim Brotherhood came in, he immediately said "Inform all Horadrim immediately. The members of the Brotherhood issued an emergency mobilization order to eliminate the Zakarum at all costs, telling them that the Zakarum are trying to summon a powerful extraterritorial demon! That is no less powerful than the seven demon kings, we can’t let this The conspiracy was succeeded!"

Tyrael's order was passed on quickly, but it also stunned the entire Horadrim Brotherhood. What does Tyrael mean? The new demon? The new demon king besides the seven demon kings?

Where did it come from?

Regardless of the beliefs held by the members of the Horadrim Brotherhood, Tyrael remains unaware that there are actually eight prime evils instead of seven. Nonetheless, he is deeply concerned, as he recognizes the demonic symbols inscribed within the ritualistic magic circle. The title [Your Majesty] is exclusively reserved for those demons who belong to the highest echelons of the Demon King hierarchy.

"O...Osiris? That's how it is pronounced, right..." Tyrael repeatedly watched the picture in the shadow stone, and finally read the pronunciation of the name in the devil's text. But after saying the pronunciation of the name, Tyrael was a little confused again.

Because in his impression, he didn't seem to have heard the name of a demon king like this...

"Perhaps, I should return to the High Heaven..." Tyrael calculated "There is a projection of the Book of Truth from the Garden of Eden in the High Heaven. Maybe I can find the origin of this demon from the book of truth..."

As the realization dawned on him, Tyrael swiftly embarked on his journey back to the High Heavens. Following the conflict with Malthael, Tyrael's relationship with the Archangel of Valor, Imperius, had gradually improved. Considering the circumstances, there might be a chance to consult the Book of Truth and uncover information about... Baal.

However, what Tyrael didn't know was that during the time he was on his way to High Heaven, the world of Sanctuary had undergone tremendous changes.

In accordance with his directives, the Horadrim Brotherhood dispatched a substantial force to eradicate the followers of Zakarum. Naturally, many descendants of the Nephalem joined their ranks. However, as one of the smaller Nephalem groups stumbled upon a gathering site of the Zakarum cultists, they soon realized they had unwittingly walked into an elaborate trap.

Within this gathering point, a multitude of tens of thousands of Zakarum cultists suddenly swarmed forth, encircling the small group of Nephalem and launching a ferocious and relentless assault. The ensuing battle resulted in substantial casualties. Resorting to overwhelming numbers, they managed to apprehend Tyrael's team.

In fact, this is a conspiracy by Mephisto. Mephisto knows very well that with the scattered distribution of Zakarum followers, he is unable to organize a huge summoning ritual from the chaotic world. Summoning Roy from outside, so he first asked the Zakarum to hold rituals to confuse the Horadrim church. After they paid attention to it, he let the Zakarum set a trap and caught the team of Nephalem. people.

It feels a bit loud...

Nephalem as a hybrid product of angels and demons, possess powerful soul power. Using them as sacrifices can offset the huge consumption of the sacrifice ceremony...

In the end, the Zakarum killed the group of Nephalem. With their blood and souls, plus thousands of Zakarum who died as sacrifices, they finally activated the real sacrifice call. ceremony!

The blood-red magic circle light of the sacrifice ceremony rose into the sky, and the sky of the Eastern Sanctuary also looked strange and terrible because of this light. Under the dim sky, the priest of Zakarum who presided over the ceremony looked excitedly at the high sky. The vortex of the clouds shouted "May the sun fall to the western dust, may the light disappear, use the sacrifice as a guide, rise from hell, and let the abyss come! The king of winter! The ruler of darkness! The ruler of blood and thunder! Singer of frost and fire! Emperor of disease and war! Eternal masters of the dead! In the name of my lord Mephisto, our humble servant sings your real name here, Your Majesty Osiris! I beg you to follow The abyss is coming!"

This summoning spell is sung in a devilish language. It is the spell sung by Sareth when Roy descended into the world of Devil May Cry. After Roy agreed to Mephisto’s request, he wrote this The spell and give it to Mephisto, then Mephisto told the Zakarum cultist to use this spell to call Roy to ascend.

The whole world of the sanctuary is actually an egg-like world. The sanctuary is in the center, similar to the yolk, and the periphery is the chaos world like the egg white. In fact, it is the so-called purgatory space. The entire world is wrapped in an egg shell. Forming a kind of closure effect, so the space door to be opened for this summoning ceremony is also different from the space door normally opened inside the sanctuary. It is a space-time door that opens from outside the egg shell (outside the domain).

As a result, the impact of this summoning ceremony is completely unprecedented. The entire eastern sky of the sanctuary has a vision. The blood-red light can be clearly seen hundreds of miles away. Countless hunters who have observed the vision here The demons all hurriedly rushed towards here.

But they were too late. As the priests continued to chant over and over again, the magic circle that absorbed the blood and soul of the Nephalem was constantly increasing its power and outputting its magic power. Numerous hair-like magical lightning flashed in the sky. In the light of this lightning, a deep and dark fissure appeared high in the sky and began to slowly expand.

The malicious dark aura of the abyss world is revealed along with the slowly opening space crevices, making everyone who feels this breath have a creepy panic. The weak civilians have long been looking at the blood-red sky in the distance. Kneeling on the ground, holding his hands and praying non-stop.

In the end, this dark and deep space crevice expanded at high altitude into a circular plane with a diameter of ten kilometers.

Under the excited gaze of the priest Zakarum, under the gaze of countless people who were frightened and disturbed, a demon wrapped in huge wings slowly penetrated from the plane of the fissure!

The huge contrarian wings slowly opened, revealing Roy's hideous face, the scarlet demon eyes are like electricity and light, and the semi-substantial edges of the body are flowing with mist like water, giving people a dreamlike illusion. A feeling like that, accompanied by Roy's appearance, the surrounding air was trembling, making a whine-like scream.

It seems that the movements he comes are getting bigger every time. After all, no world would welcome such a powerful alien species as him, but unfortunately, the will of this world is simply unable to resist...

Here comes, Roy.
