# 503 - Magic Town

The sky is dim.

The thick dark clouds blocked the moonlight, making the earth black. In that twisted cloud layer, a flash of lightning would light up from time to time. Only at this time would the earth light up for that moment.

The foul-smelling and smelly cold wind is howling, rolling over the rocky mountains and valleys. In the depths of the valley, there is a dilapidated small town, where there is no one inhabited, and the broken windows and eaves follow the wind that rolls up. The creaking sound was one of the few noises in this silent town.

A group of scavenging crows hovered over the town. The dark feathers on their bodies were moist and shiny and they seemed to be well fed.

There are several big trees in the town that have withered long ago. On the bare branches, there are several shrunken bodies hanging from them. Those are human corpses that have already been air-dried. These corpses are swaying and swaying with the airflow. With sunken eye sockets staring at the town at his feet, most of the buildings in the town have collapsed. On the building rubble, there are still traces of scorching. Some broken swords were thrown away in the town in a mess. Everywhere, looking at the black color on it, don’t know if it is the bloodstain of their former owner or the blood of the enemy...

Here lies an abandoned town within the human world of the Sanctuary, mirroring countless others scattered throughout its expanse. These territories, painstakingly established by pioneers over decades, are prone to sudden collapse and ruin, sometimes crumbling in a single moment.

However, amidst the deathly silence of this town, there is a subtle anomaly today. At the heart of the town, a dilapidated church emits faint, flickering lights, while an eerie breeze carries a whispering murmur. No peculiar sounds disrupt the stillness, yet an unsettling presence hangs in the air, as if the place is haunted.

In the middle of the night, about two kilometers away from the town, several war horses appeared. On the backs of these horses were several people who covered themselves tightly. These people came on horseback and were about to approach. When they arrive in town, they gradually slowed down.

The leader dismounted his horse, planted his feet on the ground, and revealed his face by removing his cloak and hood. Before us stood a robust and weathered man, with a towering physique and a face adorned with numerous scars. His wild blond hair was tied up and neatly arranged atop his head, while two hefty axes crossed behind his waist.

After he dismounted, the other knights also landed one after another, standing with this big man, looking carefully at the dead town ahead.

"Kyle, is this the place?" The petite figures made a questioning voice, sounding like a woman. She asked "Those remnants of Zakarum are really hiding in this small town?"

"The intelligence should be okay, the number of the other party is not much!" The big man named Kyle said solemnly "But as for what the remnants of the Zakarum church are hiding here, there is no intelligence. We can only rely on us to do it. Explored."

"Then what are you waiting for?" Another man's voice came. It was a tall and thin figure. He took out a crossbow and held it in his hand, and opened the string, saying "Kill all those guys. , Leave a living and ask, don’t you understand?"

"Let's go, in the name of Horadrim!" The petite woman also took out a wand almost as tall as hers. With her voice, the crystal on the top of the wand also flashed a fiery red light. .

A group of people headed towards the small town, and the thunder light in the sky illuminates their way forward. The ghostly shadow of the small town looks so strange in this light, but they are fearless.

Because they are professional demon hunters from the Horadrim church, "ranks" with powerful strength!

After entering the town, after some exploration, the group of demon hunters also discovered the strange light in the center of the town, but when they were about to enter the church, they were attacked by a large number of monsters.

These monsters seem to have come out of the church. They have ugly faces and launched suicide attacks against the demon hunters. At the beginning, the demon hunters were patient and resisted. Under the attack of the monsters, but after a while, the demon hunters found something was wrong.

The monsters are not powerful, but there are too many of them, as if a door to hell has been opened in the church, allowing these monsters to appear continuously.

"They are delaying our time, something must be happening in the church!" the petite female mage said.

Everyone agreed with her guess, so the next second, they saw the big man named Kyle roared, holding the double axe turned into a whirlwind, and slew towards the front. The monster that rushed up was swung by his double axe. Instantly turned into pieces of flesh and blood. Under the opening of the meat grinder, the rest of the demon hunters hurriedly followed. After rushing to the church location, the female mage held the wand in both hands, and the light of magic light lit up on her. A shooting star burning with raging flames appeared in the air and slammed straight into the dome of the church.

With a loud bang, the originally collapsed church was completely lifted off the roof this time, exposing the inside.

However, it is strange that after smashing the roof of the church, the witch hunters did not find anything abnormal inside, only a door of hell shining with blood-red light was slowly closing.

"Is it over?" Looking at the hell portal that was closing, the demon hunters were a little puzzled, and felt it was too easy to solve.

Not so... right! What about the remnants of the Zakarum church in the intelligence? Why didn't you see them?

"Look for it! Maybe there are any mechanisms here!" The big man holding a double axe shook off the stumps and pieces of meat hanging on his body, and took a step forward.

A group of demon hunters searched around in the church like this. After their careful search, they finally found something!

It was a secret door close to the back of the bookcase. When the demon hunters found the mechanism and twisted it, the secret door was opened with a click, revealing a narrow passage that can only be passed by one person. Looking at the direction of the passage, it seems that it leads to the underground of the church.

Taking out the torch, the demon hunters were vigilant and began to enter the passage one after another. They had already seen that the gate of hell outside might be just a warning method. Those remnants of the Zakarum church should be hiding in the ground. In the space, if you don't hurry, they might run away.

The descending stairs were unexpectedly long. After walking for nearly twenty minutes, they faintly saw the light that appeared in front of him, and didn't know where it had gone underground.

At the exit, the demon hunters carefully leaned out to observe, only to see a huge underground hall with torches burning all around, illuminating the weird blood red devil text on the wall, in the middle of the hall. A huge six-pointed star was etched on the ground.

At the sharp corners of each six-pointed star, there are now dozens of believers wearing the costumes of the Zakarum church. These believers have fallen into a pool of blood, but look at the enthusiasm that still remains in their eyes, as well as holding hands. Holding the hands on the hilt of the abdomen, it is conceivable that they committed suicide.

The blood of these believers is flowing along the grooves of the etched six-pointed star at this moment, and the patterns are gradually being perfected.

"Self sacrifice?" The demon hunters were taken aback, and then immediately reacted and looked at the position in the magic circle.

There, a Zakarum cultist wearing a priest’s robe was chanting a spell quickly, chanting the devil’s language again, and the human language again, repeating it, as he chanted, in the six-pointed star magic circle The flowing blood also began to emit a blood-red and unknown light!

"Quick! Stop him!"

Kyle yelled, and immediately rushed towards the magic circle holding a double axe, and the rest of the demon hunters cooperated with him tacitly, and followed them together.

The hunting arrows with scarlet light were the first to shoot at the priest who presided over the magic circle. However, when these arrows just entered the range of the magic circle, they immediately lost their power and fell directly down, a huge red The mask appeared, covering the entire magic circle.

The charge Kyle was also blocked by the mask. He slammed into the mask and slammed towards the mask in pain. The rest of the demon hunters also assisted and tried to break the mask.

The priest who was singing seemed to understand that going on like this couldn't stop these demon hunters for long, so the speed of singing accelerated again.

"Damn! He wants to summon the devil!" The big man Kyle roared "These guys, don't they want to resurrect their master Mephisto!?"

"Impossible, although Mephisto is sealed, how can it be so easy to resurrect?" The female mage replied in her busy schedule "Don't think about it so much, it's true to stop him quickly!"

So a group of people stepped up the attack again.

But at this moment, the priest's singing stopped suddenly, and the blood-red mask covering the magic circle suddenly disappeared at the same time, and the foremost Kyle nearly slammed into the magic circle. Fortunately, he reacted quickly enough, stopped in time and stood on the edge of the magic circle.

The appearance of this abnormality shocked the demon hunters, thinking that the priest's ritual was completed and a powerful demon was about to come out, but then they saw the priests in the formation suddenly utter a terrible roar.

The skin and flesh on his face quickly dried up, and his whole body shrank in a circle, as if all his energy and spirit had been sucked away at this moment, and he became a dying year in an instant.

A trace of dark soul light swarmed from his eye sockets, mouth and nose, penetrated into the magic circle and disappeared. After the soul light disappeared, the priest collapsed to the ground with a snap.

"This is...backlash!? His ritual failed!?"

The demon hunters quickly reacted, staring at the magic circle whose light was gradually dissipating in surprise.

Kyle was taken aback and couldn't take care of so much. He rushed forward to the priest's body, knelt down and grabbed him by the collar. While he was still alive, he asked, "What did you do!? Who do you want to summon?"

The priest did not answer him, with a withered face like a corpse. He just opened his mouth with difficulty, and said in a hoarse voice "Not enough, the sacrifice... not enough... My lord, what you ordered, we can't... complete ..."

After speaking, the priest died completely.

Kyle heard some words scattered and didn't know what was going on, but he knew what the priest said by "my lord", it was Mephisto, the king of hatred.

What Mephisto ordered? what exactly is it?

"Damn it!" Kyle thought for a long time to no avail, and punched the ground angrily.

"It seems... we have to report this matter up!" The female mage sighed "I hope... Tyrael can give us guidance..."
