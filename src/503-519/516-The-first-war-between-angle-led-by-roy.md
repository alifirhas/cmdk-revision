# 516 - The First War Against Angels Led by Roy

For the humans in the Sanctuary, most of the time, they are on the side of the high heaven.

The reason is simple, they are often persecuted and harassed by demons! Demons with a destructive and destructive nature are the natural enemies of all living things. When human beings are unable to resist powerful demons, they will naturally fall to the side of angels.

However, over the years, there have been many wise men in Sanctuary. When they continue to study and explore the relationship between angels and demons, they find that angels are not good people. The existence of the world of Sanctuary is a mistake. Whether it's a demon or an angel, they all deliberately want to destroy this place, but compared to the tyrannical demon, the angel is just a little gentler.

In this case, human beings are naturally more willing to accept the teachings of the angels and take the Holy Light as their belief.

For thousands of years, the belief in the Holy Light has been the mainstream of the world of Sanctuary. Although there are ancestral beliefs such as barbarians, elemental beliefs of mages, and even balance beliefs of necromancers, these beliefs cannot be regarded as mainstream.

There was a period in human history when the fanaticism of the belief in the Holy Light caused these humans to reject other beliefs so much that there was a large-scale war of beliefs, humans killed each other, and the population loss was even worse than being invaded by demons. Some…

Of course, after every demonic invasion, these humans will soon unite to resist the demons.

High Heaven has been silently observing the humans in the Sanctuary, and has always been troubled by their capriciousness. Several archangels of the Angiris Council have different personalities, so they naturally observe humans from an angle. Also different.

Archangel like Tyrael, what he sees is the greatness of human courage and self-sacrifice, while what Imperius sees is human selfishness and cruelty to his fellow man, as for Malthael is as indifferent as looking at ants...

The difference in observation angle naturally determines the different attitudes of the archangels towards human beings.

In fact, the high-level paradise has not been in a good state. After Malthael fell into an angel of death, he was killed by a group of Nephalem led by Tyrael. Imperius thought that Malthael was killed. After death, the soul will be purified and reshaped, and then it will come back again. As a result, the crystal dome has never been able to condense the soul of Malthael. Imperius is very worried about this and once thought that it was Diablo's **** who would be Malthael.

There is no news from Malthael, Tyrael has an accident again, a new Demon Lord has appeared in Sanctuary, Tyrael disappeared after fighting with each other, and has not returned until now, which is equivalent to The high-level heaven lost two archangels at once!

As the leader of the Angiris Council, Imperius felt an unprecedented and urgent threat. Of course, he also knew that after the death of Malthael, the souls of Diablo and the other seven demon kings returned to the Hell of Flames. In a few years, or even decades, the Seven Demon Kings will make a comeback after regaining their strength.

The three remaining archangels are already completely out of balance when dealing with the Seven Demon Kings. If the new Demon King is added, once the war comes again, the high-level heaven may really be destroyed.

Under such circumstances, the anxious Imperius certainly hopes to find Tyrael as soon as possible, as for those Nephalem...

In the new meeting, I hope that Archangel Auriel also mentioned this matter. As the only female angel in the high heaven, Auriel also has a good impression of the humans in the Sanctuary, so she hopes Imperius can change his attitude, let go of his prejudice against human beings, and spread the doctrine of light in the world on a larger scale, in the hope of making better use of the power of the Nephalem in the future war with **** demons.

Imperius doesn't know this? Of course he knows! When Diablo entered the high-level heaven, he also saw how powerful the nephalems who started to regain their strength, but the problem was that he was quite entangled with these powerful nephalems!

As for why the entanglement is involved, it involves a mystery of Sanctuary. About three thousand years ago, when the world of Sanctuary was just discovered by heaven and hell, Lilith had already been discovered by heaven and hell. Inarius was banished to the Void, and both Heaven and Hell recklessly developed religion in the world of Sanctuary, hoping to develop power through the lever of Sanctuary in order to overwhelm each other.

At that time, the humans in Sanctuary were weak and helpless. They were pawns that angels and demons could play with at will. Even Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice, had the same attitude towards humans in Sanctuary as Imperius. , Heaven created the Holy Light Church in Sanctuary, and Hell also created Tritheism in Sanctuary. Heaven and Hell spread their beliefs while borrowing these two churches to fight proxy wars in Sanctuary.

Everyone knows that the so-called proxy war is very cruel to the proxy, because in the end all human beings die, and the angels and demons are not damaged at all...

But under such circumstances, Lilith, who was unwilling to fail after being exiled to the Void, became a spoiler. She did not know how to escape the Void—probably because when she was first exiled, she was only exiled to the Void. On the fringes of the material world—she's back once in a while.

Lilith found a Nephalem named Uldyssian. Uldyssian was originally just a poor peasant, but he was framed and persecuted by the Holy Light Church and the Trinity Church, who were preaching in Sanctuary at that time, and had to be forced to. Taking his brother and relatives away from home, Lilith found Uldyssian. She knew that Uldyssian had a powerful Nephalem bloodline, so after constantly approaching Uldyssian, she helped him liberate the powerful bloodline. Power, Lilith hoped that Uldyssian could use this power to expel Inarius and all the angels and demons.

Uldyssian hated angels and demons very much, so he did so, and he even became the strongest Nephalem in history, not even the first son of Inarius and Lilith's first son, Linarian. With this powerful force, he established another religious group, [2] Aidilun, with the aim of exposing the Holy Light Church and the Tritheism to the human beings in the Sanctuary. Although very effective at first, the Trinity was destroyed, but in the process, Lilith eventually lost control of Uldyssian and the situation. Uldyssian found that Lilith was using him, and finally weakened it. Lilith, causing Lilith to be exiled by Inarius again.

This time, Lilith seems to be banished further into the void...

Initially, Uldyssian intended to continue his pursuit of expelling Inarius. However, amidst the ongoing war, he stumbled upon the discovery of the Worldstone. Determined to harness its power, Uldyssian used his own abilities to manipulate the frequency of the Worldstone, unleashing the dormant potential of the human Nephalem. This audacious act did not go unnoticed by the High Heavens, leading to an invasion by an army of angels upon Sanctuary. Seizing the opportunity, the Burning Hells also joined the fray, transforming the conflict into a three-way showdown between the forces of Heaven, Hell, and the Nephalem.

At the end of the war, Uldyssian realized that the more powerful he used, the faster his loss of humanity would accelerate, but for the future of mankind, he resolutely decided to sacrifice himself, unleashing all the power of Nephalem, and destroying the angels. Banish all the demons from Sanctuary.

The mighty Uldyssian, with all the power he unleashes as powerful as a god, illuminates the entire world of Sanctuary...

Simultaneously, Uldyssian harbored concerns that other Nephalem would suffer the loss of their humanity, similar to his own experience following the explosive surge of power. To prevent this, he made the decision to reintegrate the power back into his own body. Ultimately, this choice led to his demise, and in the process, the power within him ceased to exist. The frequency of the Worldstone was subsequently readjusted, reverting to its original state, and the potency of the Nephalem bloodline once again vanished.

Tyrael in the war at that time saw Uldyssian's self-dedication and sacrifice, and sighed at Uldyssian's kindness and greatness.

After the war, the Angiris Council negotiated with Mephisto to decide the fate of the mortal world, and on the question of whether to forgive mortals at the council, Tyrael would cast the crucial vote against, allowing Sanctuary The world survives.

After the survival rights of mortals were ensured, the Angiris Council and the lords of the Burning Hell reached a ceasefire agreement, and both agreed that the power of the Burning Hell and the High Heaven would not interfere with the mortal world. Human beings could decide their own destiny, as this agreement In one of the terms, Inarius was handed over to the demons, who tortured him for eternity.

Uldyssian's sacrifice has won a living space for mankind. It can be said that he is called a sage by the world. However, the power released by Uldyssian when he finally expelled the angels and demons also made both angels and demons very uncomfortable. Horrible, in order to prevent similar things from happening again, heaven and **** have tacitly passed an agreement, that is, to seal all the memories of mortals about this war, so this was originally called the 'War of Original Sin' The war was completely lost in the historical records of mankind...

Among the mortals, there is only one person who still remembers this war, remembers Uldyssian, that is the one who left his hometown with Uldyssian, his brother Mendeln... But Mendeln was not in the attention of angels and demons at that time.

Imperius struggled with this. As one of the participants in the original sin war at the time, he was also shocked by the power of Uldyssian. The potential of the Nephalem race was beyond his imagination. So on the one hand, Imperius also hopes to use the power of Nephalem to defend against the demons of hell, on the other hand, he is very worried about the emergence of people like Uldyssian again. Don't fight the demons by then, and the mortals turn their heads and turn the angels again. It would be too embarrassing to be expelled from Sanctuary again.

After thinking about it, Imperius also rejected Auriel's proposal. He believes that the war with the demon is the responsibility of the angel. Even if it is out of balance with the power of hell, don't you even have the courage to fight?

Auriel could only sigh about Imperius's decision. She also knew the potential meaning of Imperius's words. Now that the situation is unclear, how could Imperius be so cowardly to seek mortals? help? Where does the pride of an angel go?

Therefore, Auriel could only acquiesce to Imperius' decision.

It's just that they didn't know that this decision completely ruined the chance for High-Order Heaven to finally win over the Nephalem...

The estrangement between the high-level paradise and the mortal world of the Sanctuary makes them very slow to respond to various information in the mortal world. Just when the angels are still living a long and boring life as always, the situation in the Sanctuary world is not. more and more intense.

Due to Roy's decision to hide behind the scenes, the mortals in Sanctuary have not suffered from demons for a long time.

The Worldstone was destroyed, more and more human beings began to gradually awaken the power of the Nephalem in their blood. However, due to the sudden acquisition of powerful power, their minds and thoughts could not keep up, resulting in more mortal worlds. Many madmen with extraordinary powers use their power to obtain money by any means, bullying or even killing people weaker than them, making the security environment of the entire human society very bad.

It can be said that this is a very special period for human beings. Uldyssian re-seals the power of the Nephalem and it is estimated that such a situation will occur, but humans have no memory of the original sin war. In this case, no one can raise the alarm, and people think that this is the best time for Sanctuary.

Everyone has the hope of awakening their bloodline and becoming stronger. After the Worldstone was destroyed, the shackles that imprisoned human beings disappeared, so naturally, the idea of ​​​​groups began to rise, and many people began to believe that human beings should control their own destiny.

It has to be said that Roy's arrival was chosen at a very good time. After losing the threat of demons, and the Zakarum followers he sent out lurking in the crowd to continue bewitching, human beings are very interested in The disgust of the Holy Light Church began to rise sharply, and the demon gold circulating in the human world was also constantly amplifying the ambitions of human beings.

With the passage of time, a terrible incident occurred, a cathedral of the Church of the Holy Light was burned down, on the grounds that the priest in the church was hiding female slaves.

As a place for spreading faith, churches can be said to be huge in the world of Sanctuary, so of course it is impossible for every church to have angels in charge. It is always human beings who manage churches, and as human beings, it is also very harmful for priests to appear privately. It's normal, but it's bad that this kind of thing happens in such a period.

In this way, it is a bad dish. Now that the idea of ​​​​groups is on the rise, this kind of thing can easily be spread, and then infinitely magnified. For a time, human beings are excited, and more attacks against churches also appear. And because of the contradiction between theocracy and kingship, countries have also begun to condone such attacks.

In just half a year, an astonishing number of churches have been burned down in various countries in the Land of Sanctuary. A large number of church personnel have been turned into prisoners and exiled, and the voice of expelling the Church of the Holy Light has been loud.

After the high-level heaven found out, things were completely out of control, and the high-level heaven could no longer tell who was behind the scenes.

Imperius knew that if these events could not be stopped quickly, the high heavens would completely lose the faith of mortals, but Imperius, who was embarrassed and aged, made a wrong decision on this matter.

He sent angels to put down these rebellions!

Ordinary angels have always been disgusted by the Nephalems who already have demon blood, so the suppressed angel troops naturally caused huge casualties in Sanctuary, which intensified the conflict.

The Nephalem people realize that even if the shadow of the demon has disappeared, the existence of angels is still a big mountain pressing on their heads. If human beings want to win an independent living space, then whether they are demons or angels, they must be expelled. Object.

As a result, the Nephalem people began to resist the high-level heaven. Now they have powerful powers, they can also suppress the army of angels in turn. They began to gain pleasure from beheading these angels who used to symbolize light...

The irritated Imperius didn't stop Auriel's advice at all. Anyway, there was no demon to disturb him. He simply led the army and directly invaded the world of Sanctuary... In this way, Roy came to the fifth place in this world. Year, the war between humans and angels begins!

The history of this world, because of Roy's appearance, has completely moved to an unknown turning point...

As for Roy himself, he is silently accumulating the power of the demon. He has now completely become the spokesperson of the flaming hell. During the period when the Seven demons have not returned, he is the supreme leader of the entire flaming hell. The army of millions of demons is ready to go, just waiting for Roy's order, they will completely destroy the entire high-level heaven under the leadership of Roy, kill all the angels, and completely end the eternity of this world. battle.

Of course, this is just the idea of ​​the demons, but they don't know what Roy is really thinking. With so many troops, Roy is not only guarding against high-level heaven, but more is actually guarding against Lilith...

Although Mephisto's warning is mixed, Roy believes that Lilith's return should be true. Through his historical interpretation of this world, Roy estimated that Lilith in this world is afraid of being caught. Exiled into the void for thousands of years!

After such a long time, the ghost knows what Lilith has become. Maybe Lilith will become a Void Lord at the moment of her return, so it will be a big game.

The scene of the chaos dragon Urgash being corrupted by the void is still vivid in his mind. At the moment when Urgash escaped from trouble, the entire Ashan world was destroyed. Roy can be said to have a deep memory. At that time, Roy still There is no way to deal with the power of the void, but this time is different. He became the chaotic power mastered by the Demon Queen, which has been proved in the demon May Cry World. That time, Roy used the power of chaos and the power of the void to fight, repair and close it. The gate of the void, if Lilith is really corrupted by the void, then Roy also has the confidence to touch Lilith.

Time to get a head-to-head with these Void creatures...

While watching the war between humans and heaven with cold eyes, Roy was still studying one thing, and that was the Worldstone.

Although the Worldstone was destroyed in the last war, there has been a special rhetoric among the wise men in the Sanctuary world recently.

They believe that the Worldstone that was destroyed when Diablo woke up and attacked the High Heavens last time was probably just a fragment of the Worldstone. Otherwise, if the Worldstone was really destroyed, the Sanctuary should also fall apart.

After all, the world of Sanctuary was created with the Worldstone as the cornerstone. Now that Sanctuary is still intact, it means that the body of the Worldstone is still fine.

The wise believe that the body of the Worldstone should be extremely huge, and it is hidden in the core of the planet underfoot!

For this argument, Roy believes that it is credible, because it is impossible to imagine that a Worldstone with a diameter of only one or two meters can be used as a cornerstone to create a world the size of a planet, so Roy also believes that it should be There is an even larger Worldstone body.

Moreover, in the eternal war, the war between angels and demons is also to a large extent competing with each other for the Worldstone. If this thing is really so fragile, I am afraid that it has been destroyed in tens of thousands of years of war, where is it? Possibly kept for so long?

The reason why he is so interested in the Worldstone is because Roy feels that this thing is probably a legacy of the creator!

Yes, Roy felt that it should be the real legacy of the creator, not the legend of the so-called creation **** Anu's eyes.

As far as Roy knows at present, among the items related to the legacy of the creator, one is the demon's Bible stone tablet left in the abyss world, the other is the true book of heaven, and the other is Lilith's Red Sea Egg (suspected). The creator-like relics contain some kind of magical power, which are the traces and imprints left by the creator when he created thousands of worlds.

Roy doesn't know what these things are for, but since he has come into contact with them, he will naturally collect them subconsciously. He has collected several pieces of the demon's Bible Stone Tablet, and they are all placed in his portable space. The Egg of the Red Sea also in his hands.

As for the Book of Truth, maybe when you enter the High Heaven, you will be able to see it...

The rest of the Worldstone, if it is really the last word of the creator... Well, it is really difficult to get hold of this, unless the entire world of Sanctuary is blown up...

While thinking about it, Roy waited. Finally, after the trust relationship between human beings and heaven collapsed rapidly as the war intensified, Roy knew that his first chance to lead an army of demons to fight against heaven was finally at last. here comes...
