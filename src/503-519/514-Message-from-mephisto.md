# 514 - Message from Mephisto

Roy's plan and layout have begun to bear fruit, but this is just the beginning and it will take more time for the rift between humans and angels to expand.

As the black hand behind the scenes, Roy is not in a hurry at all. He has even prepared to use five to ten years to complete his plan step by step. Anyway, as a demon, he has a long time and life to wait.

Of course, it's not that it really takes that long. Roy and other steps to advance the progress are being implemented step by step.

When he was just called to this world before, Roy left the Zakarum High Priest with a demon eye. Although these Zakarum believers belonged to Mephisto, this did not hinder the Roy uses them.

After contacting the high priest of the Zakarum religion, Roy gave them an order. Roy order them lurking in various cities, mingle with ordinary people, waiting for an opportunity to provoke the relationship between humans and angels, To promote the attitude of high-level heaven, especially Imperius towards human beings and other good stuff. Whether they use public opinion or create conflict, in a word, try their best to make the relationship between humans and angels worse.

It is not only necessary to fan humans against angels, but also to fan angels against humans. If possible, try to attack some high-level heaven's stations in the Sanctuary as a human being.

In addition, Roy also gave a large amount of gold to the Zakarum believers. This gold is naturally the demon gold that Roy carried. The demon gold originally had the curse of bad luck, but Roy used the system to target it. Modifications.

The curse of doom of the devil's gold was originally used to obtain human souls, but Roy does not need these souls yet. If people who touch gold end up dying of bad luck, it will attract attention after a long time, and people in the church may The gold was collected, so Roy changed his doom attribute.

> ***Demon Gold (Version 2.0)***

- *Corruption*: Gold with dark power will amplify the negative emotions in people who have been in contact and held for a long time.
- *Hidden*: Dark power in gold, undetectable by any magic.

These negative emotions, including greed, anger, jealousy, and many other. When Roy handed the gold to the high priest of Zakarum, he told him to circulate the gold through reasonable channels and use the gold as much as possible. It circulates like normal currency in the various human settlements in Sanctuary.

Roy is very clear that the demon blood contained in the blood of the Nephalem will be continuously stimulated after coming into contact with this gold. Over time, the Nephalem will gradually become selfish, irritable, belligerent and tyrannical. The good side of them will be covered up and the evil side will be revealed.

In this way, Imperius, who had no good feelings for the Nephalems at first, will become more and more disgusted with the existence of human beings. Maybe it will not be long before he will bring up the old story and re-launch the proposal to destroy the Sanctuary.

The high priest of Zakarum, who was already corrupted and depraved in his heart, did not have any resistance to Roy's order, but carried it out ecstatically.

Everything is under Roy's control. If he sees this series of arrangements from a human perspective, he will definitely shudder, but in fact, Roy's original intention is not to target Nephalem. The real target is the high-level heaven!

As for the Nephalem race, Roy actually knows nothing better than to say, not to mention the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse that he first came into contact with, but to say that he still has a adopted son Sareth who is also Nephalem. He knew very well that these Nephalems were actually not enemies to demons. As long as demons' bloodline prejudice aside, it could be said that it was easier for demons to accept them than for angels to accept them!

Angels are the worst enemies of demons. No matter which world Roy goes to, he is most guarded against these angels. Now he is just using the Nephalems of this world to achieve his goals...

Time passed slowly, and the chaos in the Sanctuary was revealed day by day. Roy was sitting alone in the Demon King's Palace, reading a book:

- The Book of Cain,
- The Black Book of Lam Esen,
- The Book of Zakarum,
- [2] The Book of Skasimmi,
- The Book of the Mage Clans,
- [2] The Book of Sage,
- Tale of Horadrim,

These books are shelters The legends and historical books circulating in the land, Roy copied them into books and read them constantly. His plans and layouts all came from reading these historical books, which allowed him to have a deep understanding of the various races in this world. contradiction between.

Just when Roy was watching with relish, the lights in the Devil's Palace suddenly dimmed.

Shadows climbed in the hall, covering the light of the lights, and a deep darkness began to fill the hall of the Demon King.

Facing this strange situation, Roy watched coldly, he smelled a familiar smell from the pervading darkness, so he couldn't help but snorted coldly and said, "Mephisto What are you trying to do by pretending to be a ghost in front of me?"

"Hey hey hey!" A hoarse laughter came, a shadow slowly emerged from the ground, and then slowly transformed into a huge demon image.

This huge demon has two pairs of exaggerated demon horns on its head, especially the pair that is turned out. He floats in mid-air, with a pair of bone-like arms, and the demon claws look extremely ferocious. The demon wings also looked like bone wings, and some dark chains were wrapped around his arms and bone wings, making a clanging noise.

The most outrageous thing is that he didn't have a lower body. The dangling lower body was replaced by a fog-like darkness. From his abdomen, he could see the vertebrae behind him hanging straight down, connecting with the bone whip-like devil's tail. The overall image is no different from a skeleton.

"Osiris, we meet again!" After Mephisto appeared, a grin appeared on his face, and his hoarse voice sounded very maddening.

Roy closed the book and snorted coldly, "Why, are you finally going to hide? I thought you were going to keep watching the show!"

"Of course not, we are allies!" Mephisto floated on Roy's throne and swayed, saying "Also, your actions are beyond my expectations, more powerful than I expected! Of course I want to Come and meet you"

"Huh, ally?" Roy stepped off the throne, stood opposite Mephisto, looked directly at him and said, "Since you are an ally, why are you lying to me? The dark soul stone is broken, you and you My brother has already escaped the trap, why did you tell me when you were looking for me that you were still trapped?"

"About this, I apologize!" Mephisto rubbed his chest and bowed slightly to Roy and made another noise with the dark chains on him. He straightened up before continuing "Osiris, forgive me. Frankly speaking, does your coming to this world have anything to do with whether we get out of trouble?"

"That's true!" Roy nodded "The reason why I am here is nothing more than Lilith, the life and death of your Seven Demon Kings have nothing to do with me. From the beginning, what I said to you It's just a skeptical attitude, so it doesn't matter if you deceive me or not..."

"Hehehe, you are so straightforward!" Mephisto laughed along with him.

Roy stared at Mephisto for a moment and said, "If I read it right, Mephisto, you are just a ray of projection incarnation, right? So, the matter of your rebirth in the Black Abyss of Fiery Hell, is it true?"

"That's right!" Mephisto nodded and said "The Black Abyss is a powerful magical creation, with the same effect as the gate of the abyss, it can bind the devil's soul in it, once the devil dies, The soul will return to the Black Abyss first, not the abyss world... After the dark soul stone was destroyed, my brother and I went back to the Black Abyss, but soul cohesion and rebirth is a slow process, we I haven't fully recovered yet, and I'm still sleeping."

"Then you are here now, what do you want to tell me?" Roy asked.

"The High Priest of Zakarum spoke of your plan during the sacrificial rituals offered to me. While he may not possess a complete understanding of your intentions, he perceives that your focus lies upon the High Heavens, and it appears to be yielding favorable results. As allies, we cannot simply stand idly by. I am here to inform you that my brethren and I have amassed a formidable demon army within the Fiery Hell. When the need arises, you may open a portal to summon them at your command, and they will unwaveringly obey your every order."

"Oh, that's not bad!" Roy nodded and said, "What else? If it's just the army, it's not worth your special trip."

"There are two more things!" Mephisto also reached out and stroked his devil's horn and said "The first thing is, if you plan to completely defeat the high heaven, then there is one thing you need to be careful about. After the real defeat of the heaven side, it may lead to the appearance of the guardian Trag'Oul!"

"Trag'Oul?" Roy frowned suspiciously: "I seem to have heard this name somewhere..."

"It should be the "Book of Rathma!" Mephisto reminded "The religious scriptures of the necromancers!"

Roy nodded, yes, he remembered.

"Trag'Oul, the guardian of the Sanctuary, is described in Rathma's book as a giant dragon, a giant dragon formed by the gathering of stars!" Mephisto said "She is with the Sanctuary. It appeared when the land was created, and even Inarius and Lilith, who created Sanctuary at the time, didn't know her existence, and we didn't know it at the beginning. It was only after the appearance of the Necromancer that we discovered this guardian, She rarely appears in front of the world. She is never interested in the war between angels and demons. She is only dedicated to guarding the balance of Sanctuary. This balance is likely to be broken when you capture the high heaven. At that time, she It is very likely that they will intervene!"

"Is Trag'Oul very powerful?" Roy asked.

Mephisto nodded and said cautiously "Very powerful, because after my research, I found that she is very likely not a real dragon, but a star soul Titan!"

"Huh!? What? Star Soul Titan!?"

After hearing Mephisto's words, Roy couldn't help but be shocked...
