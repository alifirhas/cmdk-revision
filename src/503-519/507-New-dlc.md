# 507 - New DLC

In the cold and lonely mountains in the north, Roy spent quite a long time acquiring information about the world.

Sharpening knives without chopping firewood, Roy's harvest is quite large, he can fully understand the situation in this world, and understand why Mephisto and the others are such a powerful demon force, were repeatedly appear in this world reason of failure.

In addition to the soul stone that originated from the worldstone and was produced by the first Horadrim Church, there is another reason that cannot be ignored, and that is the worldstone.

This Worldstone, believed to be a transformed essence of the creator, God Anu, was initially housed atop Mount Arreat in Sanctuary after it was stolen from the High Heavens by Inarius. Since Sanctuary is an artificially created realm, it lacks inherent world will. However, when Inarius placed the Worldstone on the summit of Mount Arreat, it unexpectedly assumed a different role. Instead of possessing the will of the world, the Worldstone gained the ability to repel and diminish any angels or demons entering Sanctuary from the realms of purgatory beyond.

After all, Inarius defected at the beginning, and he didn't want Sanctuary to be discovered by the High Heavens, as did Lilith. So they used the power of the Worldstone to block the Sanctuary as a whole.

What does this mean? It shows that when Mephisto, Diablo and the others entered the world of Sanctuary, they were actually weakened. All kinds of unfavorable factors added up, so that Mephisto led his brother in the The process of starting a business in Sanctuary can be described as extremely difficult.

A sad story of demon kings who failed in the middle of their business... Roy felt wronged for them.

Fortunately, the Worldstone was destroyed not long ago. It was a little vague how many years ago. At that time, Baal, the King of Destruction, planned a conspiracy to take the opportunity to invade Arreat. The Holy Mountain took the Worldstone stored there and corrupted it with his own power, because humans (Nephalem) are descendants of angels and demons, and Inarius adjusted the Worldstone to suppress humans. nature, and Baal's corruption of the Worldstone will induce humans to twist evil. If the corruption is allowed to continue, humans will completely fall to the side of the devil.

The higher heavens also realized the seriousness of the matter, so several archangels held a meeting to discuss whether to destroy mankind.

The Archangel of Justice Tyrael cast a key negative vote at the moment that determines the survival of mankind. Then, in the absence of a choice, Tyrael had to destroy the Worldstone with the brilliance of the Holy Feather in order to prevent mankind from completely falling to hell. .

The energy of the Worldstone was released in an instant, causing a big explosion, and the holy mountain of Arreat became the giant pit of Arreat.

Without the Worldstone, it means that the Sanctuary's weakening and rejection of demons does not exist, which is why Roy feels so comfortable after coming here. That slight hostility is just that It's just a residual effect of the Worldstone.

The power of the demons is no longer suppressed. It is said that Mephisto and the others have the power of their heyday, and they should be able to push horizontally in this world, but unfortunately, the Worldstone affects not only the demons, don’t forget At the beginning, Inarius also adjusted the Worldstone, which affected the Nephalems, and as soon as the Worldstone disappeared, the suppressing effect on the Nephalem also disappeared.

Consequently, the inhabitants of this world began to reclaim the ancient wisdom embedded within their blood and souls. They delved into the depths of profound elemental and arcane knowledge, harnessing these hidden forces to unlock greater power. Step by step, they advanced towards the prowess of the first generation of Nephalem, drawing closer to the legendary abilities of their ancestors with each passing day.

Diablo, who took advantage of the destruction of the Worldstone and took the opportunity to make a comeback, just happened to hit such an era of nephalem aura recovery, even if he once led an army of demons into the High Heaven, even suffered heavy losses. The Archangel Imperius of Courage turned the High Heaven into a sea of ​​fire, but with the help of the Nephalem who recovered his powerful strength, Diablo was still defeated and sealed again. In the soul stone...

When Roy saw this record in the book of the New Horadrim Church, he couldn't help but scolded Diablo with an MMP!

How strong are the restored nephalems? Roy is quite clear about this. The reference object is the four knights of the apocalypse. In Devil May Cry World, the four knights of the apocalypse beating the Archangel Jubileus are still vivid in his mind. They are all gods. The same Archangel, the power is almost equal to Diablo and the others.

The four-on-one fight is impressive, so how many Nephalem did Diablo encounter?

The picture of twenty-five-footed men beating a pill appeared in Roy's mind, and he couldn't help shivering. Diablo encountered more than twenty-five-footed men, two hundred and fifty. It is possible! After all, in the world of Dark Bloodline, there are only four of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse left in the Nephalem bloodline, and in this Sanctuary, the pits and valleys are filled with Nephalems. Under such a huge base, even if The Nephalem who regained knowledge and power is only a small part, and that is also a considerable number...

Roy summed it up and found that Diablo was not wronged...

The destruction of the Worldstone is good news for Roy, but at the same time, he also realizes that the large number of Nephalems here is also a huge threat to him. If he does not want to repeat the mistakes of the Seven Demon Kings, he This threat must be taken seriously.

As a demon, Roy is not like other demons. He has his own set of logic for doing things. After sitting on the Ice Throne for a whole month, Roy finally stood up.

From the portable space, Roy took out a huge... egg!

Needless to say, this is naturally the Egg of the Red Sea. Since knowing that Lilith exists in this world, Roy made up his mind to bring the Egg of the Red Sea before he came. After placing the Egg of the Red Sea in the cave, After letting it enter the cultivation state, Roy flew out of the cave.

He plans to grab some powerful demons from the demons raging around in this Sanctuary, and then use the eggs of the Red Sea to cultivate a more powerful special demon.

This will be an important part of his plan, and Roy calls his plan:

[The Fall of Taibama] DLC...

***

Roy finally started to move, but little did he know that a group of people had begun to take action during his time on the Ice Throne.

This group of people is the New Horadrim Brotherhood!

Tyrael finally came back from the High Heaven. He brought back the book of truth stored in the High Heaven. Although this book is only a projection, it still connects all the strongholds of heaven in the world. The angels are there. The names of powerful demons encountered on various battlefields will be recorded in the Book of Truth. This is a special way for angels to seek demons. Once a dangerous and powerful demon escapes to a certain world, the world's Angels are obliged to kill them.

Obviously, as a powerful demon who has turned over many upper rank angels, Roy's name is on the list in the Book of Truth, but unfortunately, because Roy is rising too fast, let alone heaven. Now, even the demons in the abyss world don't know much about Roy, so there is only Roy's single name on the book of truth, that is, the name **Osiris**. Some of Roy's power characteristics, such as the black ice power he uses, but there is no explanation for Roy's origin and bloodline.

It's just a single name, even if it's part of the devil's real name, it doesn't work. It's natural to want to attack Roy's soul by reciting the devil's real name, so Tyrael's first investigation of Roy, reached a deadlock.

"What is the purpose of his coming into this world?"

"Do you want to release the Seven Demon Kings? Or do you simply want to destroy the world and harvest souls?"

"How did the Zakarum believers know his name and summon him?"

"What is his relationship with the Seven Demon Kings? Is it cooperation or competition?"

"How powerful is his power? What are the odds of winning against him when the archangels of the high heavens face him?"

"It's been a whole month since he came to the present, but there is no news about his activities at all. Where is he hiding? What is he conspiring?"

There were too many questions. Tyrael, who turned into a human, was looking at the book of truth under the light of the candle, thinking with a headache, the dim light of the shaking reflected on his dark face, let him People can't help but have an illusion, as if Tyrael has sunk into the darkness...

"I... have an uneasy premonition!" Tyrael closed the page, the book of truth disappeared in a burst of light, and said to himself "Why is this uneasy premonition so strong? Is this called Is the Demon Lord of Osiris stronger than both Mephisto and Diablo? Will he bring greater disaster to the world?"

Out of the secret room, Tyrael came to the main hall. The mages of the New Horadrim Church in the main hall stood in two rows, watching Tyrael quietly, waiting for his order.

Taking a deep breath, Tyrael said "Peace and tranquility are short-lived. Since the fall of Chaos Fortress and the death of my brother Malthael, only a few years have passed, now a new darkness has come again. An equally powerful demon king has descended on the Sanctuary. He is from the abyss world shrouded in the deepest darkness, where all the demons originate, an unimaginable horror world, and the demons living there are all It is the most powerful demon with the purest malice! Although I don't know why the Demon King Osiris came, protecting the world of Sanctuary is the most important mission of our New Horadrim Church. Justice and courage are with us. Now, get ready to meet the devil!"

The mages bowed in unison, turned to leave, and everyone had a determined look on their faces.

After that, a large number of scouts and messengers ran out of the Church of New Horadrim and scattered to all parties in Sanctuary. These scouts and messengers would bring news to the various kingdoms and human gathering points in Sanctuary, informing them that they were in Sanctuary. Prepare for a new round of demonic forces before attacking, and at the same time, in the name of the Horadrim Church and the Archangel Tyrael, the powerful Nephalems will be recruited so that they can slay the demon king Osiris.

From this moment on, a new chapter in the history of Sanctuary will be opened...
