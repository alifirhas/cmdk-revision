# 521 - The Battle of Authority and Power

With holy flames burning all over his body, Imperius took the lead and rushed to Roy again.

Looking down and seeing him rushing towards him, Roy waved his hand and hit him with several huge black lightning bolts. However, at the moment when the lightning fell on Imperius's head, Imperius's body suddenly turned into a ray of light. Leap forward in the form of the speed of light, dodging the lightning strike.

The black lightning kept adjusting its position and falling, but Imperius avoided it by leaping forward. His figure flashed flexibly on the battlefield, approaching Roy quickly from left to right.

This time, Imperius did not attack Roy's head, but held the spear of courage and slashed at Roy's waist horizontally. With the movement of his spear, a huge arc-shaped flame The chopping wave appeared, and a gap was directly torn out of Roy's waist.

His attack landed, yet the weapon lacked any discernible impact. Astonished, Imperius swiftly evaded and vacated his previous position. No sooner had he moved away than a ferocious column of hellfire erupted from the ground beneath him. A sudden explosion ensued, and the fiery surge soared into the heavens, engulfing the very spot Imperius had just occupied.

Although the first blow was dodged by Imperius, pillars of hellfire erupted one after another on the ground, chasing his location and bombarding him constantly. Imperius had to change positions quickly and finally he flashed to the back of Roy. Positioning himself, seized the opportunity to counterattack. He jumped to Roy's back with guns in both hands, arched his body and inserted the tip of the gun into Roy's back.

Facing Roy's huge body, his strike was like jumping into a fog, but he still didn't have the feeling of hitting as he expected. A hole was drilled in the middle and rushed out from the front of the chest.

"Damn it! These mists are incorporeal!" Imperius cursed, but before he could readjust his stance, a cluster of black light erupted beneath his feet! It was as if it had been lying in wait for him at that precise spot...

"Not good!" Feeling the biting cold breath in the black light, Imperius immediately judged that it was the absolute zero-degree attack just now, but it was too late for him to flash again, and the surrounding black light burst out. That circle of space has been blocked by Roy's attack.

The strong cold air of absolute zero broke out in this small space, causing the flaming holy flame on Imperius to be suppressed back to the surface of the body, and the armor on his body instantly condensed frost. The speed of light was severely slowed down. Imperius only felt that all the horizons in front of him were suddenly plunged into endless darkness, he could no longer see any colors and things. His movements were stopped almost instantly and his thinking began to slow down.

The endless darkness in front of him continued for such a long time, and it seemed as if 10,000 years had passed by Imperius, until an ethereal voice slowly entered his mind.

"Im...pe...ri....s"

"Im...pe...rius..."

The voice that came into his mind, at first every word had to be delayed for a long time, and then the interval was gradually shortened, the finally turned into an anxious shout.

Imperius gradually regained his senses, his vision slowly returning and the darkness dissipating. Before him stood a figure, initially shrouded in shadows, but gradually transforming into the familiar form of Auriel.

"Wha... What happened?" Imperius asked in a hoarse voice, covering his head.

"Don't moved!" Auriel saw that his thinking had recovered and then explained with relief "You were engulfed by that dark space just now and I used the rope of hope to forcibly pull you out. But you didn't move after you came out..."

"Yes... is it?" Imperius asked, shaking his head vigorously, "How long have I been in there?"

Auriel replied "It's just less than a second! When you launched an attack, Itherael judged that you were in danger. I shot the rope of hope according to the direction he instructed and the dark space was completely closed. In an instant, I pulled you out... Fortunately, if it was a little later, you might have been completely frozen..."

"Is it less than a second?" Imperius raised his gaze to survey the battlefield and noticed Tyrael assuming his offensive stance, wielding the holy sword. Itherael was aiding him in the assault, while the demon king Osiris took charge. Reflecting on the recent encounter, Imperius couldn't help but feel a shiver down his spine, whispering, "It felt as though I had been trapped in darkness for countless millennia... It was an utterly terrifying experience. Auriel, I am grateful to you for saving me."

Auriel couldn't feel what Imperius felt just now, and asked curiously, "Is it really that scary?"

"Trust me! Feeling of death is more heartwarming than that!" Imperius said as he ignited the holy flame again. After leaving the absolute zero space, the holy flame on his body also turned the frost on his armor. Dispersed, but after the black ice crystals fell off, Imperius noticed that his armor had been damaged. Under the extreme cold, even if it was forged in the high-level heaven holy light forge, The incomparably sturdy Archangel armor also had numerous tiny cracks, and these cracks were almost all over the body.

Fortunately, using the power of authority, Imperius can draw endless magic to repair the armor, it just takes a little time.

"I'm on, this time I'll fight alongside Tyrael!" Imperius said cautiously "You and Itherael pay attention to assist us, because only your thread of hope can save us from that kind of darkness. Pull it out of space!"

"Leave it to me!" Auriel nodded.

Imperius' body turned into a ray of light and flew towards the battlefield. At this moment, Tyrael was caught in the fiery hurricane shot by Roy. In the powerful hurricane connecting the ground and the clouds at both ends, the violent destruction flames filled it. Just whistling and scrolling rapidly, Tyrael was in this fiery storm, being continuously burned, and he could only hold up the Holy Light Shield to resist with difficulty.

Imperius rushed into the hurricane without hesitation. Dozens of spear tips of the spear of courage appeared around him. These spear tips transformed by his holy light were also burning with powerful holy flames. Under the command of Imperius, these spear tips flew to various parts of the hurricane, although they exploded, offsetting the power of the hurricane with the force of the explosion.

When the fiery storm dissipated, Tyrael was also rescued. His originally dark face was now red because of the high temperature and it looked really black, red and translucent.

"The nature of his power has changed too much!" Tyrael said after seeing Imperius "Osiris seems to be able to control all elemental powers, but these elemental powers are not in the conventional sense, but Mutant elemental power!"

"I realize it too!" Imperius nodded and said, "But the most important thing to be careful about is the dark absolute zero-degree space. Once caught, it will be over and it may killed you directly and the soul may not necessarily be can escape..."

"How on earth are we going to attack him?" Tyrael said with a headache "That foggy body has no entity at all, even the wind can't blow it away, and the power of the Holy Light can't cause damage to him..."

"..." Imperius looked at Roy, who was not far from the opposite and found that the other party was not doing anything at the moment, as if waiting for them to attack. He guessed that the Demon King Osiris might be brewing something.

The key now is how to break the game. There must be some way to kill the Demon King Osiris. Otherwise, if they keep fighting like this, they will definitely be the four angels who will fail in the end.

Fighting has always been what Imperius is good at. In the course of thousands of years of battle, Imperius also has his own unique war wisdom. After thinking for a while, Imperius suddenly turned his head and looked at him. Auriel not far behind.

"We need to use the power of Auriel!" Imperius said "With the power of her 'hope'!"

Tyrael immediately understood when he heard it.

Auriel's "Hope" authority may sound a little difficult to understand, but in fact it is a very unique power, because as long as "Hope" exists, it can bring "Miracles"!

The so-called 'miracle' here refers to certain events with super small probability. If a battle has a 99.99% chance of failure and only a 0.01% chance of victory, then Auriel's power is to lead everyone to find that 0.01 % The power of victory!

Before, she used the rope of hope to pull Imperius out of Roy's absolute zero space, relying on this kind of 'miracle' power, even if there was only a slight possibility, she could rescue Imperius from it. Oh, Auriel can do it too, and with the power of fate, Ethereal predicts certain scenes and tells her it, and it's even easier for her to do it.

In other words, this is a power that belongs to the European emperor...

Now, in the regular battle mode, the archangels can't deal with Roy, so they can only find a way to use Auriel to find a 'miracle' and gain insight into Roy's weakness. They believe that no matter how powerful the devil is, it is impossible Really invincible.

"Alright, this time it's time to fight side by side!" Tyrael laughed "Imperius, I'm not talking about you, you charge alone every time, and we haven't been able to cooperate with you for a long time. The last time Diablo invaded the High Heaven was also...‚Äù

Imperius' face darkened when he heard this. The last time he faced Diablo, his old opponent, he was terribly beaten, making him angry when he remembered it. It was a humiliating defeat, but Tyrael This guy just doesn't open the pot and lifts it...

But now is not the time to pursue these things. When he saw Auriel nodding to him, Imperius knew that Auriel had understood his own mind, and Itherael was also by her side. Working together, he will definitely be able to find a way to defeat the Demon King Osiris. Now he just needs to keep attacking and attacking with Tyrael.

However, before the two could launch an attack, they saw Roy, who had not moved much, slowly raised his arms. When the huge misty body made this action, the mist that was stirred up like ink flowed again.

"It's done!" Roy's soft voice rang out and then he saw that in all directions around the entire Silver City, a large number of demon children with small wings suddenly appeared in all directions!

These demon children are the ones that he kept spreading out just now. The reason why he has been passively defending against Imperius and Tyrael's attacks is that he is arranging and spreading these demon children.

Attacking the high-level paradise is not Roy's job alone and he is not arrogant enough to think that he can attack the high-level paradise alone. After he entered the high-level paradise alone, he just stabilized his feet first.

Now, with the completion of the arrangement of the demon children, it is time for the war to enter the next step.

A large number of demon children with wings are scattered all over the battlefield. After receiving Roy's magic power transmission, these demon children radiated bursts of light, the light continued to spread, and the portals were also destroyed.

"Open it up!"

Ten, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of portals opened at the same time, which was already the limit of Roy's magic power, and as soon as these portals opened, a lot of terrifying roars came from door to door.

When the first demon jumped out of the portal, demons jumped out from all the portals one after another. In less than ten seconds, all the portals started to pour out like dumplings and kept spitting out Demon army...

In just a moment, hundreds of thousands of demon armies have invaded the high-level heaven, and the bell of war has been sounded...
