# 535: In the name of despair

After the violent burst of light, the disintegration of the crystal arch followed, huge spider web-like cracks spread all over the surface of the tower crushed into stones of various sizes from hundreds of catties to hundreds of tons collapsed. It fell from a height of three kilometers and hit the ground with an astonishing loud noise and tremor.

In every corner of the High Heaven, there were still some surviving angels who did not give up their resistance and still fighting against demons, but after the strong light that erupted just now, they all involuntarily looked up in the direction of the crystal arch. They could only stare at the collapsed scene in stunned silence.

The crystal arch is the belief of all High Heavenly angels. For many angels, the crystal arch has been standing there from the moment they were born. It has stood for thousands of years. In the thinking of the angels, they would never thought it would fall.

But now, this scene has really appeared. The angels thought they had seen an illusion and couldn't believe it.

Among those witnessing the cataclysmic event, there were beings whose expressions mirrored that of the angels. These beings were the demons. Despite their incessant clamor for the downfall of the high heavens, they had never truly comprehended the spectacle that would unfold when their desired destruction became a reality. As they beheld the crumbling of the Crystal Arch, the very symbol of the high heavens, confusion gripped them. Just like the angels, they stood in stunned silence, unable to fathom the unfolding events before their eyes.

As a result, the collapse of the crystal arch lasted for more than an hour. Everyone in the High Heaven watched it for more than an hour. The thrilling scene had made them forget that they were still fighting.

The crystal arch, which was more than three kilometers high, finally collapsed and the ruins left behind were more than two hundred meters high, and the smoke and dust it set off filled the area for hundreds of kilometers, it did not disperse for a long time. Because of the massive loss of holy power, all the angles became fragile. God Anu's Crest Crystal was blown into countless fragments in the explosion. These fragments were buried in the ruins along with the rubble at the moment. Even so, the black desolate virus attached to these fragments has not yet spread. After disappearing, the energy-loving virus is still greedily absorbing the remaining energy in the debris.

These shards resembled the flickering life of a dying patient, their dark light a desperate attempt to cling to existence. Gradually, their feeble struggle waned until every trace of energy was depleted, leaving them enveloped in complete darkness. This marked the dissipation of the High Heaven's last remnants of light.

As the immense tremors subsided, the demons snapped out of their stupor. Once they comprehended the magnitude of the event that had transpired, a unified roar of exhilaration erupted from their ranks.

This time, the entire High Heaven, all kinds of roars of demons resounded, celebrating the victory!

Afterwards, the demons looked at Roy who was slowly descend in the sky with frantic eyes. They shouted the name of Osiris, the king of demons, and squatted on the ground, paying Osiris the highest tribute to the demons.

At this moment, to the demons, the name of Osiris is even greater than the Seven Deadly Sins...

As for the surviving angels, there is only endless sadness left at this moment. They looked at Roy with hatred, but none of the angels launched a vengeance charge against Roy, because they all knew that the High Heaven was over.

Incomparable despair grew in the hearts of the angels. They pulled out their weapons, pierced them into their chests, and chose to commit suicide to be buried with the High Heaven.

However, since God Anu's Crest Crystal had collapsed, after these angels committed suicide, their souls could not find a place to go, so they could only keep hovering near the corpse.

Roy, who was slowly falling, did not see these suicide angels, but an inexplicable feeling made him turn his head and look at the location of these suicide angels. After thinking about it, he waved, and soul turned into a streamer and flew towards his location.

After the soul flew into Roy's palm, Roy discovered that these sacred angel souls, which were supposed to be golden, actually revealed a gray color, and the angel faces that flashed from time to time in the soul were also a numb expression.

Almost at the moment of contact with these souls, Roy noticed an extreme negative emotion from these souls!

This feeling is called "despair"!

Angels will have this kind of emotion, but Roy can understand that the destruction of the crystal arch means that the High Heaven has completely fallen, and the remaining angels are unable to save, so that they commit suicide in despair. These dying emotions are completely inherited by the soul, and finally Formed this [desperate soul].

However, these are not what Roy cares about. What he cares about is that these desperate souls are actually resonating with his Mobius Mark!

Roy realized something, so he swallowed these desperate souls without thinking about it. Not only that, he waved again, and more desperate souls left by suicide angels kept moving towards his position.

There were even some clever demons who saw Roy's intentions, hugged the desperate souls they found at their location, and rushed towards Roy, intending to dedicate them to Roy.

In the end, there were more than 1,400 souls of despair collected by Roy, which was also the last number of surviving angels. After they witnessed the collapse of the crystal arch, their souls all turned into souls of despair.

Roy devoured all these despairing souls and not storing it in the system interface as usual.Whenever he devoured a despairing soul, he could feel that his Mobius Mark became stronger.

Yes, Roy finally figured out what his power is, that is... despair!

This is the power of authority that belongs solely to the demons, epitomizing their inherent traits and negative emotions. Mephisto embodies hatred, Diablo instills fear, Baal unleashes destruction, Belial weaves webs of lies and deceit, Asmodeus revels in sin, Duriel inflicts pain, and Andariel inflicts torment. These distinct emotions, borne by sentient beings in their own unique ways, serve as fuel for demons to enhance the potency of their Mobius Mark and authority.

With each surge of these emotions, the demons harness their true power and amplify their influence over the realms. It is a twisted symbiosis between darkness and despair, a grim reminder of the malevolent forces lurking within the depths of the demonic realm.

It is worth mentioning that the negative emotions that can be used by different demon kings are different and the increase of authority and power caused by these negative emotions is also different. Negative emotions that are easy to obtain will increase the authority less, and it is difficult to obtain them. The negative force of the power will increase the authority even more.

The emotions of desperation that Roy can tap into are rare and elusive among intelligent beings. Such emotions only arise when one is truly pushed to the brink, facing dire circumstances and overwhelming despair. Consequently, acquiring these "desperate souls" is no easy feat. They are scarce in number, but their impact on Roy's Mobius Mark and authority is tremendous.

The potency of these souls, laden with the weight of desperation, greatly enhances Roy's abilities and grants him unparalleled strength. Through the connection to these rare souls, Roy taps into their deep reservoirs of anguish and channels them to fuel his own power. It is a symbiotic relationship, as Roy harnesses their desperation to elevate his own capabilities, giving him an edge in the face of formidable challenges.

In particular, it is even more rare when the soul that produces this kind of emotion is still an angel soul.

After swallowing the despairing souls of these angels, the bottom-level information of the world that Roy saw through his authority became clearer, and the "strings" that could be plucked in the past also became thicker. These are the power of his authority.

Since it didn't take long for him to become a demon king, Roy was very unfamiliar with how to use his power in the past, and he didn't know how to strengthen his power, so he still chose to fight without it. In the past fighting methods, more use of magic and chaotic power to fight.

But now, with the clarity of the meaning of power, Roy finally knows what his power can do.

He lowered his head and looked at the rock fragment of a crystal arch in the ruins. This rock fragment was very huge, weighing thousands of tons. However, Roy only slightly hooked his fingertips at it and saw Countless cracks suddenly appeared in this huge rock fragment.

Thousands of tons of rock shattered into countless tiny fragments in a short period of time. These fragments were further decomposed and turned into countless dusts. In the end, even these dusts disappeared.

The whole process didn't seem like a big deal, but only Roy knew that he had actually plucked a "string" just now, injecting the power of "desperation" into this rock fragment.

Yes, even inanimate objects devoid of consciousness can be affected by despair! When this emotion takes hold, even rocks and fragments can experience a sense of existential doubt and then undergo a process of desperate disintegration. The very essence of their being seems to question its own existence, leading to a cascading collapse driven by sheer desperation.

The actual process is like this, it may be a bit complicated to describe, but it is such a process, Roy's authority and power can make any substance enter a state of "self-destruction"!

This is a very powerful power. In theory, his power is very difficult to decipher. Of course, although the use of this power does not consume any magic power, it needs to consume a lot of Mobius Mark power. With Roy's current Mobius Mark state , it cannot be used frequently and continuously, and the self-destruction of matter can only be done at the macroscopic level, and it cannot be done at the molecular atomic level for the time being.

This requires Roy to take more special [Desperate Soul] to improve...

After realizing this, Roy also felt a little regretful. If he had known that he would have left more angels, the more angels who witnessed the collapse of the crystal arch, the more desperate souls he might get.

But in such a large-scale war, many situations are out of control, so Roy just regretted it for a while and didn't think about it.

He looked at the large number of demons who were all around him, and saw that they were all crawling around the ruins under his feet, waiting for him to speak, so he floated up slightly, showing his misty body, loudly roaring filial piety

"My name is Osiris! In the name of the King of Despair, I hereby declare the destruction of the High Heavens! Declare the defeat of the archenemy Angel! Declare - the end of the eternal war!"

As Roy's voice fell, countless demons gathered in the High Heaven made a frantic roar. They were venting their excitement that was about to get out of control. After the roar, they shouted loudly in demon language. Roy's real name.

On this day, a name resounded through hell and heaven, through Sanctuary, through the entire Diablo world.

"King of Despair - Osiris!"
