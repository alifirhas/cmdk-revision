# 512 - Spooky Figure

It takes a long time for pure void power erosion to transform a material world individual into a void and the more powerful the individual... the longer it takes.

Archangel like Auriel, even if he is immersed in this void, Roy is not sure how long it will take for the erosion to complete. So this is just a move of Roy's passive action. After leaving Auriel's location, Roy wandered in the void.

In the pair of huge misty wings behind him, just like breathing lights, some strange-looking lines flickered on and off. This is the automatic appearance after he set the void flight ability for himself. On his foggy wings, these lines seem to be formed by the system itself, which may be called [Void Runes]. When these rune patterns shine, Roy can move freely in the void.

Although there is a war going on in the high heaven, Roy is not in a hurry at all. Mephisto and the others have prepared a huge number of demon armies for him in the Hell of Flames. These demon armies cannot be exhausted for a while. More elite demonic creatures have yet to appear.

Opportunities to enter the void world are rare, and naturally, Roy is hesitant to depart prematurely. However, the reality is not shaped by human desires. After aimlessly wandering for over an hour, regret begins to consume Roy's thoughts, as he realizes the stark truth...

"This place really has nothing".

Empty, silence, nothingness, even if there is an eye of the void that allows Roy to observe the void world, but there is nothing in this world for him to observe, the incomparably huge void world, no matter which direction it flies, it is exactly the same, there is no end, There are no edges.

Roy originally wanted to try to find out if he could find Lilith's trace, but now that he looked at it, this idea was unrealistic, and he couldn't find it at all. It was like looking for a specific water molecule in the huge Pacific Ocean. Same, it's really hard.

Roy couldn't find any trace of Lilith and the legendary creature of the void. Roy didn't know if it was not born yet or if it was rare to come across. In short, after wandering around for a while, Roy decided to give up. There is no need to waste time in this empty world.

With determination, he set his sights on a direction and sprinted with increased speed. As he soared through the void, Roy's senses gradually picked up the presence of the demon child he had left behind in the higher realms of heaven. The strengthening signal of their connection indicated that the direction he was heading was indeed leading towards the void, nearing the proximity of the material world. As long as he maintained his forward flight, he would eventually reach the very edge of the material world.

I have to say that Tyrael and Itherael really used a lot of effort to banish Roy into the depths of the void. Sprinting at Roy's current speed, it took a long time to finally return to matter Above the edge of the world.

However, Tyrael and the others probably would not have thought that Roy could move freely in the void world. You must know that the reason why people who were exiled to the void are difficult to return is largely because they cannot move in the void. They need the help of people on the material world side to "pull" them back with external force. To do this, not only do they need to establish a connection between the material world and the void world, but also some special ceremonies are often required. That's right... This is also the reason why they couldn't pull Auriel back immediately. They can only prepare for this matter after the war in the high heaven is over.

Throughout the ages, people who can take the initiative to return to the material world from the void world can be said to be rare as a miracle...

But now, there is one more such miracle. After confirming that the signal between himself and the demon Child was completely stable, Roy immediately started the exchange. He saw a flash of light and Roy's figure disappeared immediately. At Roy's location, a little demon child suddenly appeared. This demon child who fluttered his little wings was trapped in place and couldn't move. After just a few seconds, it was eroded by the power of the void, disappeared completely, and turned into a part of the void.

Right after the demon child vanished, deep within the void, a sudden flicker of golden eyes emerged. These eyes possessed the distinct slits of a typical demon's gaze, yet their golden hue seemed peculiar.

With the opening of the golden demon eyes, a body of the same color as the void appeared. She seemed to be completely integrated into the void, and the entire body only had the outline of a lake.

Of course, even if someone is nearby at this time, it is impossible to see this scene in the void environment... There is an extremely cold look in the golden eyes, this strange figure silently floats in the void, only stayed in place for a while, and then started to move.

It's just that the movement of this figure is not like Roy, who is flying by the wings of the void, but maintains a rigid posture, flashing abruptly in the void, and the flashing trajectory is also a bit strange, not towards a The direction flashed, but the left and right, the front and the back, the completely incomprehensible trajectory.

If you observe carefully, you will find that the power of void erosion has no effect on this figure. The particles around her body that should have been eroded and dissipated are in a strange state of cessation, and some particles are even half dissipated, but the other half still exists.

It was as if the time around her body had been completely stopped...

In view of the strange flashing trajectory, it took a lot of time for the figure to come to the area where Roy and Auriel were before. At this time, Roy had already left, and only Auriel was still curled up in the original area. Still focusing on resisting the combined erosion of the void and the curse.

This figure stood quietly beside Auriel, her golden eyes stared at Auriel coldly, and after a while, she slowly raised her hand, a layer of invisible and intangible power quickly Covered Auriel's body.

Enveloped within an imperceptible shimmering aura, Auriel remained unaware of its presence, yet an unexplainable sensation of distinctiveness engulfed her being. Had Roy been present, he would have observed her being encased in this ethereal film of light. Auriel herself experienced a heightened sense of agility, as even the most subtle movements of her body seemed accelerated, causing her radiant wings to leave trailing afterimages with each unconscious flutter.

This is an incredible phenomenon. Outside the invisible light film, everything is very usual, but Auriel in the light film seems to be fast-forwarded...

Seeing this scene, there was a cruel smile in the cold eyes of the owner of the golden eyes, and then she did not move, the began to flash again. The trajectory of each flash was exactly the same as when she came before, but it's a series of regressed images! like rewinding...

It wasn't until in the end that she retreated to the position where she first appeared and after it was exactly the same, she closed her eyes again, and the whole figure was once again integrated with the background of the void...

All this happened silently from beginning to end, this figure seemed to have never appeared, only the invisible light film that wrapped Auriel remained...

***

In the high heaven, the war outside the Silver City is still going on.

At the moment on the battlefield, in addition to the clouds and mist, there are countless gray-black fine particles. These are the last remnants of the demons killed by the angels with the holy light during the war. Under the burning of the holy light, they died. The demon's soul returned to the Hell of Flames, but the corpse turned into these black ashes, which were left on the battlefield, fluttering along with the shock waves caused by the battle, and had filled the entire battlefield.

One can imagine how many demons died at the hands of angels during this time.

The demon side suffered huge casualties, and the angel side was not far behind. A large number of gray and defeated angel armors were embedded in the earth in various strange postures. These are the relics left by the angels who died in battle. The fallen angel armor has been trampled by thousands of demons at least.

This is a battlefield like a meat grinder. The bloodthirsty demons never know what it means to retreat. After arriving from the flaming hell to the high-level heaven, they continue to hit the city walls of the silver city, and the angels who come up to meet each other. In the fight, out of hatred for the power of the Holy Light, the demons did not need any command at all, and they spontaneously fought against the enemy.

Such a crazy offensive, the effect is naturally there. During the period of Roy's departure, the barrier of the Silver City has been broken due to exhaustion of energy, and the flying demons have already flown into the Silver City and started the destruction. Unfortunately, the ground troops failed to keep up, these flying demons ended up being strangled by angel warriors.

The reason why the ground troops could not keep up was because they were blocked by the Diamond Gate. This incomparably solid gate, together with the equally strong city walls around it, firmly protected the Silver City. The gigantic demons were banging on the city walls and gates with their weapons, but they couldn't leave the slightest trace of damage on them.

This is where the confidence of the high heaven comes from. The sturdiness of the gates of diamonds and the city walls has been verified in countless eternal battles. Out of their trust in the gates of diamonds and the city walls, the angels execute them in an orderly manner. Follow Imperius's battle orders.

After Roy was exiled, the three archangels freed up were able to join the battlefield commanding troops. Except for encountering some powerful demon lords, neither Imperius nor Tyrael did much. Most of the time, he is commanding the angel army to fight.

As for Itherael, he has already returned to the Destiny Library. He is not very good at fighting himself, so now his task is to use the power of the Destiny Scroll to find a way to find Auriel's location and put his own Bring back the sisters.

Imperius is in command, Tyrael is attacking the portal with a part of the army, and wants to close the portal to prevent more demons from entering the high heaven. Everything is going on in an orderly manner, and the balance of victory is moving towards high heaven. One side leans.

However, just when Tyrael felt that victory was in sight, a powerful and familiar aura of power suddenly appeared on the battlefield!

Without the slightest sign, Roy just came back, back to the battlefield of the high heaven!

Flying high in the sky and witnessing the appearance of Roy, Tyrael gasped at this moment, his blood pressure soared and his brain was dizzy, and he almost fell from a height like this...
