# 520 - The Battle of Power and Power

"Shut up! Demon!"

Hearing that Roy actually said that he was a thief, Tyrael couldn't help it. He pointed at Roy with the holy sword and said, "Even though I can't see your plan, this soul stone isn't your intention at all. Now, although you got your wish to find your soul stone and found the position of the High Heaven, don't even think about taking the soul stone back! In the name of High Heaven, we will judge you!"

"Tsk tsk, it's this kind of speech that stands on the high point of morality! You angels are always like this..." Roy shook his finger "Tyrael, although you used to be called an archangel of justice, you really does not represent justice! In my opinion, the fight between angels and demons is not a fight between justice and evil, but just a boring fight... Look at the current situation in Sanctuary, the angels are fighting against each other. The Nephalems committed murder, even if you really claim to be righteous, tell me then, will you judge the culprit for this murder, your brother Imperius?"

"..." Tyrael was at a loss for words and didn't know how to answer this question.

"Can't you answer it?" Roy mocked "So you are just double-standard. All the judgments you make are only based on your inherent cognition, because the demon is your enemy, So demons are evil and are to be destroyed and angels are your brothers, even if they do something wrong, they can be forgiven and corrected, right?"

"Shut up!" Seeing Tyrael's speechless appearance, Imperius stood up and scolded "Demon, we are not here to argue with you! Tyrael, can't you see? Come out, he's just provoking us!"

Tyrael also reacted, shaking his head and said "Indeed, this is an internal problem of our High Heaven, I will not listen to your provocation!"

As a result, when Imperius heard this, his nose was about to crook (if he had any) what is our internal problem? Could it be that you really want to judge me after the fact?

This guy Tyrael has been with humans for too long, he can't even figure out his own position, and his brain is so funny...

As a main battle faction, Imperius was really tired of these verbal debates. He walked to the front, raised his right hand covered with golden armor, and saw a circular vortex hole immediately appeared in the clouds in the sky. The light quickly fell from the vortex and landed in front of Imperius.

There was a sound of clang and the falling light turned into a huge golden spear, the it was inserted into the ground like that. Perhaps because the speed of the fall was too fast, the whole gunshot was still red and hot.

This is Imperius' archangel weapon, called **Solarion**! Gun of Courage! It is about three meters long, and the spear tip is double-edged, similar to the shape of a double-strand fork, but it is closed together, like the tip of a sword. The spear body is covered with exquisite patterns, and the gaps between the patterns are engraved with sacred runes, the powerful Holy Light power fills the entire gun, making these runes sparkle.

Imperius stretched out his hand, pulled the spear of courage from the ground, and pointed the spear at Roy with one hand "Come on, demon! No matter who you are, you will have to pay blood for trespassing in High Heaven at all cost!"

Imperius's movements are the signal. Behind him, Angle of Hope - Auriel also showed her weapon. She held an angel sword in her right hand and an angel spear in her left hand. Swords are only standard weapons of High Heaven. Her real archangel weapon is actually wrapped around her hands and arms, the streamer called **Al'maiesh**, also known as the 'Cord of Hope'! This long silk-like cord is usually wrapped around Auriel's body, and it is even part of Auriel's hood.

As for Angel of Destiny Itherael, his weapon is the **Talus'ar** in front of him, the scroll of destiny! He didn't show much of a fighting stance, but the scroll of destiny also became a lake beside him. The original golden scroll turned into a variety of weapons, and there was no fixed form.

The four archangels spread their huge wings of light and spread out slowly. They floated in the air. The four people and four directions just surrounded Roy's position. In the silver city in the distance, there were countless The angels danced, and they were like dazzling stars, dotted all over the silver city, they sang the passionate angel battle song, cheering for the four archangels.

Such a grand and majestic scene made Roy a little excited. Facing the four archangels at the same time, Roy didn't dare to care about holding back. He directly entered the state of liberation of his real name!

The flesh and blood texture on his demon body disappeared, and the size of his entire body began to grow larger. In the fog on the head, a new demon eye opened. This golden third eye representing the The Eyes of the Word and Roy's original scarlet eyes complemented each other, leaving a trail of light in the fog.

In just a moment, Roy's entire painting style changed completely, and a chaotic demon with a height of dozens of meters appeared in front of the four archangels.

"This... what kind of monster is this!?" Angle of Hope - Auriel looked up at Roy in a stunned manner, even if they were all floating in the air, they still had to look up to see Roy's face.

If they had to use words to describe their feelings at the moment, it might be the same feeling that humans look at the first machine... Roy's misty body has a natural advantage in visual effects and the four archangels have not seen it before. The real bodies of the demons of hell, but such a huge body, even the seven demons of deadly sin never had.

Among the demons, the huge size often means the strength...

But these are not the main ones. The main thing is that Roy suddenly changed from the dark wind to the Cthulhu wind. The four archangels found it a bit difficult to accept, they had never seen such a demon...

"Where did this Demon King Osiris come from!?" Tyrael also muttered to himself in surprise. When he was locked in the Soul Stone before, he was still a little unconvinced in his heart, thinking that he had been hit by Roy's conspiracy and tricks, he has not used the power of authority, but now after seeing Roy's true name liberation state, he realized that Roy also did not use all his strength to deal with him at that time.

"Humph! So what! Holy Light has nothing to fear!" Imperius snorted coldly and activated the crimson light wings behind his back slammed together. And his whole body became like a stream, holding the spear of courage and rushing towards Roy.

"Let me take you for a ride!" Imperius roared, as the potent holy light coalesced at the spear's tip. As he charged towards Roy, the concentrated holy light remained fixed, transforming into a colossal beam that hurtled towards Roy's head with fervor and intensity!

No one would doubt the power of Imperius' strike, but in the face of the blasting beam of divine punishment, Roy just raised his left hand and blocked it in front of his face. In the palm of the mist, there was a touch of Incomparably intense and deep darkness was gathering, and the beam of light slowed down at a speed visible to the naked eye as it shot towards Roy's left hand!

"Dangerous!" Imperius, who charged with a gun, felt a strong sense of crisis in his heart when he saw this scene, and hurriedly stopped his movements in mid-air.

In the state of absolute zero, what will the frozen light beam look like?

Imperius may not have seen it before, but now he has finally seen it. There is no thrilling big scene, but it looks extremely simple and strange. It was originally extremely active, with super high-energy holy light. But it break down those elemental particles called photons directly lost all activity and energy levels. The photons no longer glowed and the golden beam of light became pitch black, harmoniously blending into the deep darkness in Roy's palm.

It can't be said to be swallowed, nor can it be said to be assimilated, because the area in Roy's palm is a completely still and silent space, and all substances entering this area will completely stop.

This kind of power is the strength of Roy's daring to face the four archangels at the same time. As long as the archangels are still using the power of the material level to attack him, he can resolve them. This is the real invincible effect!

In a sense, this is very similar to the nulling effect of the void force...

After becoming a Chaos Demon, it was the first time that Roy had used this kind of power to deal with the enemy. In the past, he just tested it alone. Now, looking at it, the effect is beyond imagination in the process of fighting the enemy.

The darkness in Roy's palm did not dissipate after annihilating Imperius's divine punishment beam, but continued to spread. Imperius, who was close, immediately felt the strong chill that spread out, and he fought. He immediately pulled away and flew back.

He flew back to Auriel and said without turning his head in surprise "Absolute zero!? How is this possible, there are really creatures that can control the temperature to this level!?"

"I'm afraid we're in big trouble!" Auriel changed her tone and her voice sounded very serious "The power of Demon King Osiris is beyond imagination, he is not the king of demons in the conventional sense! When will the abyss world make such a monster!?"

"Let's go together!" Tyrael's voice came and he said very cautiously "I played against him before, I thought he was just not afraid of the Holy Light, but I really didn't expect him to do this, we must Find his weakness and use the power of authority!"

The four archangels nodded in unison and in the next second, Imperius rose up with a golden holy flame!

This is the power of his "courage". As long as Imperius still has the courage to fight in his heart, he can continuously draw endless magic from the whole world. Any injury he suffers will be reflected in the determination of courage. be healed!

After using the power of authority, Imperius rushed to Roy again without fear, just like he had been doing for a long time, always charging at the forefront, even if he knew that the enemy's power was incomprehensible, he is fearless!
