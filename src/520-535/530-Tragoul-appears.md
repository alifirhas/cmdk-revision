# 530 - Trag'Oul appears

The Crystal Arch, as its name suggests, is a silver-white tower that stands tall atop the heavens, reaching into the skies above. Supported by two side-by-side columns, this majestic tower culminates in a spear-like structure reminiscent of courage. The bifurcated tip resembling a lion's mane gracefully merges the two columns, forming an arch shape in the form of an intersecting X. At the heart of this intersection rests a colossal green crystal, said to be the transformed Anu's Crest Pillar. Emitting a vibrant green light brimming with unparalleled life force, this immense crystal perpetually radiates its brilliance throughout the expanse of the high heavens.

In Auriel's Garden of Hope, every time the angels sing the sacred song aloud here, the harmonious note resonates with this green crystal, and at the same time, the angels hidden in the crystal resonate soul will be reborn.

This was originally the most sacred and most beautiful scene in the high-level heaven, but it is a pity that Auriel can never see it again.

Angle of Hope - Auriel is trapped in the void, the high-level heaven has been captured by the demon army, and there are smoke and ruins everywhere. The corruption of the dark power is spreading in the high-level heaven and mottled black unclean things can be seen everywhere. The singing had long since lost its harmony and could no longer resonate with the crystal.

Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal at the foot of the silver tower, entangled Imperius and Itherael. Roy was able to easily enter the silver tower and he shuttled through the tower. In the maze-like path, looking for the road and portal to the upper level.

No matter what, the silver tower itself cannot ascend on its wings. The potent life force emanating from the green crystal continuously bathes the tower, permeating its structure. This formidable power subdues all airflow and generates a distinct, forbidding vacuum effect. Only by traversing the portals established by the angels can one ascend even a fraction of the way.

Once in this tower, the angels strode through the halls with their heads held high, they regarded themselves as the masters of the world, but this arrogant attitude soon ushered in punishment, the last time Diablo attacked. Entering the top of heaven defeated the arrogance of all the angels. He left tragic scars in this tower. Now, with the arrival of Roy, this scene seems to be repeated again. Now the entire silver tower is It was empty, except for some sacred inscriptions and buildings that glowed slightly, the tower seemed silent.

Most of the angels have died in battle, and they are already stretched to guard the silver tower. Now Roy can see in the tower, only some tall angel statues standing with swords...

Roy walked all the way, and he seemed a little uncomfortable facing this empty environment for a while. However, just as he was advancing to the middle of the silver tower, he suddenly heard an ethereal voice faintly beginning to echo in his ears.

"Stop..."

"Stop it..."

"Don't go any further..."

Roy frowned and looked around, but found that there was no one around, and all his perceptions were telling him that there were no creatures in the tower.

So, where did this sound come from?

Roy thought about it and continued to move forward, but this time, he began to concentrate on capturing the sound.

As Roy continued to move forward, the voice began to echo again, and this time it seemed to become clearer, and even the content changed.

"Stop your steps..."

"Anu's Crest cannot be destroyed..."

"It's too late to go back now..."

Roy stopped and asked the surroundings, "Who is it!? Come out!"

However, the surroundings were still so empty, and the echoing murmur continued to echo in his ears for a moment, and the owner of the voice was nowhere to be seen.

Roy had a sneer on his face, didn't he come out? Then keep hiding!

So, he ignored it and started to move forward again, no matter what the voice said, he didn't stop his footsteps, and looked like he didn't hear it.

When Roy entered the top of the silver tower all the way, and was about to approach the location of the huge crystal, the owner of the voice seemed to finally be a little anxious, and became a little anxious about Roy's.

"Osiris, King of Demons, you are making a wrong choice!"

"Anu's Crest is the cornerstone of the existence of the higher heaven, and it cannot be broken!"

"If you really do this, the balance that has been maintained for thousands of years will cease to exist!"

Roy listened to what the murmur had said before as bullshit, but when he heard the last sentence and the word 'balance', Roy stopped and thoughtfully After thinking for a while, he tentatively shouted into the surrounding air, "Trag'Oul??"

"…"

The murmur was silent for a while, and then reappeared, sighing and admitting, "It's me..."

"You really showed up!" Thinking of the information Mephisto told him at the beginning, Roy laughed and said, "If I don't point you out, are you going to keep talking to me like this?"

Trag'Oul's voice came, his tone recovered, and he said to Roy "To be honest, I don't want to appear in front of any angels or demons, but Osiris, the king of demons, what you have done threatens the whole world. The balance of the world, I have to find a way to stop you!"

"You said that to Diablo as well?" Roy asked "If I remember correctly, Diablo also broke into the Crystal Dome last time, trying to corrupt Anu's Crest, that At that time, did you also warn him?"

"...No, no!" Trag'Oul replied.

"Oh? Then why did you appear this time?" Roy asked with great interest.

Trag'Oul was silent for a while, and finally said "Because at that time, Tyrael led the Nephalems into the high-level heaven, so I know that Diablo will inevitably fail..."

Roy reacted "Necromancer? Among those Nephalems, there are necromancers? So you can know the battle situation through them?"

"Yes, the necromancer is my believer!" Trag'Oul said "When they are fighting, they pray to the way of balance and I can know everything... But this time, Demon Lord Osiris, your plan has succeeded. The relationship of the human beings and the angels has deteriorated, not even nephalem want help the higher heavens anymore, I can't see how the final outcome will be, but in order to avoid the worst, I can only show up to warn you... "

"Your so-called warning is to pretend to make some noises in my ear?" Roy mocked " Trag'Oul, the necromancer's book o Rathma describes you as the guardian of the Sanctuary. In their eye, they seeing you are a great legend, but now you are in front of me, a demon, but you don't even dare to show yourself, do you only do some tricks?"

Trag'Oul didn't mind Roy's mockery, but said "I am th guardian of Sanctuary, so I can't leave Sanctuary and exist. I can't really enter High Heaven, and I can't enter Flame Hell, so I can only talk to you through such a voice of the soul, not to be timid to you!"

"Okay, I accept this explanation!" Roy spread his hands and said "Now the question comes back... You know, I am a demon, borrowing Mephisto's words 'I am an elf who will never deny', What does the way of balance you want to protect have anything to do with me? Why should I listen to you?"

"Because of the loss of the high-level heaven, the demons of the flaming **** will ravage the entire Sanctuary. As the guardian, I must prevent this from happening!" Trag'Oul's tone was stern, saying "The dominance of the devil, for the For me as a guardian, it's not a good thing."

Roy shook his head "Wrong, if you are really the guardian of the Sanctuary, you should stand up to resist us, demons, not just here and trying to stop me from destroying the high heaven with your word! In the same way, if the flame **** is destroyed, You should stand up to the higher heavens, not prevent the destruction of the flaming hell!"

He spread his hands and concluded "To put it bluntly, if you want to be this guardian, then stand up and fight against angels and demons at the same time. That's what you should do! But have you done that?"

Faced with Roy's questioning, Trag'Oul didn't speak, and he didn't know whether he couldn't answer it or was disdainful to answer.

"You are a fake guardian! Your so-called balance is that you want to see angels and demons continue to fight for a long time, while you are hiding in the back of the world and continue to grow vulgarly, right?" Roy grinned and exposed Trag'Oul's true thoughts "Whether it's an angel destroying Sanctuary, or a demon destroying Sanctuary, it's a disaster for you! Because your power is not yet fully mature, so You can only use this method to fight for space for yourself!"

"...It seems that you demons have studied me a lot..." Trag'Oul was silent for a while, and said "I actually know that when my existence is exposed to the world, it will always arouse the vigilance of angels and demons... These situation told by Mephisto to you, right? The seven devil kings of **** are really cunning guys. They pretended not to care about my existence, but they studied me thoroughly. Demon King Osiris, it seems that you You should understand what kind of existence I am, right?"

"The star soul titan living in the world of Sanctuary?" Roy asked.

"That's right!" Trag'Oul admitted directly, saying "Demon King Osiris, I am a star-soul titan born in the world of Sanctuary. All the existences that threaten the world of Sanctuary are my enemies. If If you don't give up and move on, then don't blame me for being rude!"

"Oh? Enemy? Then what will you do?" Roy was curious about this.

Trag'Oul didn't answer, but in the next second, a strange energy field erupted in the silver tower, covering Roy. In the tower, came to a strange world.

Underneath him is a planet rotating slowly, while a colossal sun sits on his right, its corona emanating golden flames that reach tens of thousands of kilometers high, creating a breathtaking spectacle. In the distance, the endless stars shimmer, revealing colossal comets soaring through space, asteroid belts composed of millions of meteorites, and even dazzling bursts of supernovae.

It is a cosmic image that appears both captivating and perilous, combining beauty and danger in equal measure.
