# 528 - In Front of the Crystal Arch

The light is so dazzling!

The Doomsday Judgment, which fell from the sky, smashed the diamond gate, and the strong light that erupted after the collision between the two drowned the entire battlefield like an ocean. The angels and demons near the city gate were screaming in this light... turned to ashes.

After the strong rays of light, what followed was a flame wave that spread to the entire battlefield, and a huge tremor like a tenth-magnitude earthquake under the feet. The speed of the flame wave was so fast that it burned the angels who survived and the ground The huge tremor directly tore the ground beneath the demons' feet, countless cracks spread out, swallowing the unsteady demons one after another.

Mixed in the flame wave and the big earthquake, there is also a very crisp, huge sound like glass shattering.

That was the sound of the Diamond Gate. The Diamond Gate, which was originally standing tall, was so small when faced with Roy's two-kilometer-diameter meteorite. Under the huge impact force, the Diamond Gate shatter. It didn't resist for a second and was completely crushed.

The azure crystal adorning the pinnacle of the Diamond Gate shattered into countless fragments, scattering in all directions. The sturdy stone pillars that held the crystal on either side cracked at their core, causing them to crumble and collapse. Simultaneously, the meteorite itself met a similar fate, succumbing to the immense force and splitting into two halves. The remaining portion, accompanied by a deluge of blazing debris, continued its tumultuous descent, crashing mercilessly into the heart of the Silver City.

There is no doubt that this is a catastrophe in the high-level heaven. All the angels who have witnessed this scene can only watch it blankly, unable to stop it. When the last half of the meteorite hits the silver city, it set off a huge explosion in the city. After the explosion and fire, they finally reacted and rushed towards the Silver City like crazy.

Maybe they wanted to save something, but it was too late. The gate of diamonds disintegrated from top to bottom with a huge explosion, and thousands of tons of boulders kept falling down like rain. Completely collapsed in a whimper.

The Diamond Gate shattered, and a huge gap appeared on the city wall. The demons who also reacted, shouted excitedly. While they praised the name of the Demon King Osiris, they rushed towards the gap like a tide. The sporadic angels wanted to intercept them, but they were quickly engulfed by the waves of demons, without even turning over the water.

Imperius, who flew up again, stared blankly at this scene, watching this familiar scene.

Not long ago, the Diamond Gate was shattered once, that time by Diablo, when he escaped from the Dark Soul Stone, he gathered the power of the Seven Demons, defeated Imperius and destroyed it. The Diamond Gate, that time, was Imperius' first taste of the shame of failure.

However, what he didn't expect was that in just over ten years, the diamond gate shattered again under his nose, and he himself once again tasted the taste of shame.

Imperius turned his head and looked in the direction of Roy's. Anger was swallowing his heart and he was so angry that he was about to explode.

But looking at the army of demons pouring into the Silver City, he still forced himself to calm down, because he knew that he had to organize the angels to resist the attack of the army of demons.

So he glanced at Roy's angrily, turned around and rushed into the Silver City.

"It's just a little bit, it's just a little bit..." Of course Roy saw this scene, with a grin at the corner of his mouth, and slowly put down his raised right hand.

Just like countless other angels, they were born and raised within the realms of the High Heaven. It was their home, their sanctuary, and their unwavering devotion. Among them, Imperius held an even deeper attachment, for he was among the first group of angels created. Despite repeated failures that chipped away at his pride and self-esteem, fueling his growing anger, as long as the High Heaven remained standing, his unwavering devotion would endure, unbroken and resolute...

This time, Roy's demon army try attack the high-level heaven, which also caused the same effect as when Diablo attacked the high-level heaven last time, but this does not mean that he is really better than Diablo who gathered the power of the seven demon kings. Roy is stronger, but because the strategy he planned from the beginning has taken effect.

This time to attack the high heaven, Imperius hope that the Archangel Auriel will be brought into the void by him, and the justice Archangel Tyrael will be imprisoned in the light soul stone again. The entire high heaven is now left with Imperius and Itherael is only and Itherael is not very good at fighting. It can be said that if the high-level heaven wants to make a comeback, unless the Nephalem suddenly helps them, there were no hope.

However, because of Roy's strategy, the demons in the Sanctuary were restrained, which led to the main contradiction of the Nephalem people, from demons to angels. The relationship between the two parties during the honeymoon period has been the same since Tyrael disappeared. Deterioration, Imperius' pride also played a role in promoting, so the final result was that this time Roy'sd the team to attack the high-level heaven, and no Nephalem appeared to help the angels...

Roy walked towards the opening of the Diamond Gate and entered the Silver City with the army of demons. Countless demons carefully surrounded their king. After entering the Silver City, they spread out excitedly in all directions. Now the entire Silver City Among them, the explosion of magical flames could be seen everywhere, the roar of angels and the screams of demons, the sound of a large number of weapons colliding, and the black smoke pillars burning in the city, all heralded the intensification of this war.

After entering the city, Roy tilted his head and looked at the peak in the distance. The Silver City is very huge. It is not only a city where angels live, but also a powerful fortress. The area here can even be compared to a human metropolis. In comparison, about thirty kilometers away, among the countless spires, there is one of the tallest buildings standing. It is an arch, a crystal arch! It has countless diamond-like crystal faces and under the illumination of the artificial sun of the high heaven, these diamond crystal faces flash with an indescribably brilliant halo.

This halo almost illuminated the entire Silver City, and the dazzling picture was intertwined with the harmonious and sacred timbre reverberating in the Silver City, interpreting what it means to be [Heaven]!

This crystal arch is the legendary building formed by the pillars of the creation **** Anu. It is the symbol of the entire high-level heaven. It can be said that only by completely destroying the crystal arch can it represent the fall of the high-level heaven.

Of course, this is not an easy task. Even if there are no countless angels to block it, the super-strong degree of the crystal arch itself is also an important factor that makes it difficult to destroy. The last time Diablo rushed into the high It's a heaven, and in the end, there is no way to destroy the crystal arch, and can only choose the stupidest way: use the power of darkness to corrupt it.

It was such a stupid method that made Diablo consume too much time and also won a chance for the high-level heaven. In the end, Tyrael led a group of nephalem elite warriors to stop Diablo together.

These things were all told by Mephisto to Roy's little by little during the follow-up contact with Roy'sn fact, although the Seven Demon Kings in the Hell of Flames knew about Roy's plan to attack the high-level heaven, they also expressed their support, but they were actually gurgling deep down in their hearts as to whether Roy's could really enter a high-level paradise.

The reason is that the crystal arch, which is a real sacred object, is the representative of the creator's power, and Roy's may not be able to destroy it.

Of course Roy's also knew this, but that didn't stop him from attacking the high heaven.

All the angels in the silver city are concentrated in the city at this moment. They have formed defense lines everywhere to block the pace of the attack of the demon army. For these ordinary angels, Roy's do not do much, and they all handed over to the demon army. Attacking, with the portal kept open, the demons of the Hell of Flames almost came out of their nests, relying on the huge number to continuously attack, crushing the resistance of the angels bit by bit.

Imperius did not appear again, but was commanding the angel army at the rear. Roy'sew that he and Itherael should wait for him in front of the crystal arch in the end, so he was not in a hurry, just followed behind the demon army. Move forward slowly, stopping from time to time to rest and rest.

This war finally lasted for three days and three nights. During this period, Roy'ss also attacked by countless angel troops, but most of these attacks were blocked by the demons who surrounded him. Now Roy's is the representative of the flaming hell. In order to protect their king, the demons also fought back and protected them desperately. There are very few angels who can rush to Roy's the end.

During these three days and three nights of attack, the Silver City was almost completely destroyed. The battle between angels and demons caused countless spires to collapse, and the golden sunlight above the Silver City was also blocked by endless dark clouds. The sacred heaven of yore is gone, the echoing sound of divine harmony is gone, only the ruins left behind after the war are whining.

The power of the demons also suffered heavy losses. In the end, only hundreds of elite demons who survived the war followed Roy's the crystal arch, and here, Imperius and Itherael brought the last A group of angels are blocking here, and their bodies have traces of war. The golden archangel armor is covered with blood marks, and there are traces left by various weapons on it, which looks very dilapidated.

"If you want to enter, you have to walk over our corpses!" Imperius held the re-straightened spear of courage and looked at Roy's rough gritted teeth. The scroll floated beside him, emitting a divine dazzling light.

However, Roy's scorned a blind eye to them, turned to look around, and suddenly shouted "Mephisto! Diablo! Baal! How long are you going to watch!? I dare to show up!? Has the Dark Soul Stone imprisoned you so much that your courage has weakened!?”
