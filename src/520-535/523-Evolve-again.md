# 523 - Evolve Again

A fiery red streak soared through the sky, traversing the entire battlefield with the speed of a meteor.

Within the streak, a figure emanated a majestic aura of holy light. The angelic warriors on the battlefield immediately recognized the identity of this figure, swiftly making way for its passage. The airborne demons, witnessing the scene, emitted eerie screams in an attempt to halt the figure's advance.

Yet, their efforts were futile, for those who obstructed the figure met a grim fate. The fiery red streak pierced through them without hesitation, leaving their charred bodies ablaze with holy flames as they plummeted from the skies.

"Damn! Damn you all!"

Imperius roared angrily, venting all his anger on these demons who were beyond their own power. He did not kill these demons with his own weapon, neither the gun of courage, but just set off a monstrous holy flame and swept over them.

Because the spear of courage in his hand has been completely bent...

It is not broken, but it is bent at a 90-degree angle, which is no different from being broken, which means that Imperius cannot use this archangel weapon temporarily until it is repaired.

If it's just temporarily unavailable, it's not a big deal for Imperius, but the problem is that his weapon, already broke once! It was the time when Diablo gathered the power of the Seven Demon Kings to enter the High Heaven, the spear of courage was damaged by Diablo and Imperius spent a lot of effort to recast the spear of courage. It didn't take long for Roy's fist to give it a damage again...

The most vexing issue lies in the constant damage inflicted upon Roy's fist. In other words, while Imperius does not require a spear of courage to be re-forged, he must find a means to realign the spear's shaft, ensuring perfect synchronicity with himself. Even the slightest deviation in curvature would impair the tactile feedback he receives when wielding it.

This is more troublesome than casting. Even if it is really straightened, the fist mark on the gun body will be difficult to fix. When he uses it in the future, as long as he sees the mark on it, he will remember the shame of being punched away today.

It's better to go back to the furnace and recast it directly...

One can imagine how angry Imperius is in his heart at the moment. For him, whether it is Diablo or Osiris, one by one is catching his gun and smashing it. This is simply a test of his courage and battle. A mockery of the will, proud as Imperius, how could he possibly endure such humiliation?

Killing those ordinary demons could not relieve the anger in his heart at all. Now he just wanted to rush back to the battlefield and fight Roy for life and death. This humiliation can only be washed away with the demon blood of the demon king.

However, when he rushed back to the battlefield outside the Diamond Gate, he was stunned. The Demon King Osiris disappeared and Auriel also disappeared. Only Tyrael and Itherael were standing there with their heads down.

"What happened?" Imperius asked suspiciously after landing, "I just left for a while, why are Osiris and Auriel gone?"

"This..." Tyrael sighed and could only repeat what had just happened.

As a result, Imperius became furious after hearing this. He grabbed Tyrael by the collar, pulled him in front of him, and roared at him condescendingly "What!? Auriel and Osiris were banished to the void together!?"

"To be precise, Osiris took Auriel away when he was exiled... I'm sorry Imperius, the incident happened suddenly, and we couldn't stop it!" Imperius grabbed Tyrael collar tighter.

"you!"

Imperius pushed him away, roaring pitifully "Then what are you still doing here now!?" Why not quickly bring Auriel back from the void?"

"..." Tyrael said nothing.

Luckily, Itherael explained at this time "Sorry, Imperius, when Tyrael and I joined forces to exile Osiris, we used almost all our strength. He was exiled to the depths of the void, and there is no chance for him to return. After a long time, we can use the power of void erosion to completely destroy him, so..."

"So where Osiris was exiled to the Void, you don't know, right?" Imperius was so angry that his hands trembled a little "If you can't find Osiris, you can't find Auriel, what do you think? Tell me, you sacrificed Auriel while destroying the demons, right!?"

"Perhaps in the future, Auriel can be retrieved through the power of the scroll of fate, but now..." Itherael looked at the chaotic battlefield, where angels and demons were fighting fiercely.

Looking at the gun of courage in his hand and at the chaotic battlefield, Imperius finally said nothing, turned his head and left with a cold snort.

He also knew that the first task now was to repel the attack of the demon army and finding Auriel's position from the void was a meticulous job and they didn't have so much time to do this now.

However, Imperius couldn't hold back the anger in his heart. The loss of Auriel, his sister, made his heart hurt, but it seemed that he cared more about not being able to defeat Osiris with his own hands and wash away his shame..

This kind of angry emotion, in the depths of Imperius's heart, burned more and more, and was about to devour him.

Itherael and Tyrael looked at Imperius's back from behind, they were also sensitively aware of Imperius's emotional changes. They both recalled the previous revelation on the scroll of fate, which came from The Prophecy of the Book of Cain for Mortals.

It seems that the prophecy has begun to be fulfilled again...

***

Void, what is it like?

Whether it's an angel or a demon, there are actually quite a few who have witnessed the void, but basically there is only an impression of "infinite darkness", but the real void, or what it is like to be in the void, no one knows.

But now, there is an archangel and a demon king who are experiencing this feeling.

After being exiled, Roy found that everything around him had completely changed, and all the things in the original field of vision had been replaced by darkness.

Here, there is no light, no air, no dust, no water molecules, not even electromagnetic waves, and no radiation field. The darkness is not because the place is full of dark elements, on the contrary, this darkness is because there is nothing.

It can be said that it is not even exist and he cannot feel the existence of any space here. He does not even know whether he is in a certain space.

Being in the void is a feeling that is difficult to describe accurately. Roy feels that he is not as good as a blind person. There is nothing around him that can be fed back to make him feel, and even the eyes of Godhead cannot see any information.

Except for itself and time.

Time seems to exist here, because Roy can still move, which means that time has not stopped here, otherwise, he should be completely unable to move, and since he can move, it shows that Roy still has control over himself.

At this moment, Roy has been released from the state of true name liberation and restored to his original material body.

As for Auriel, Roy didn't know where she was. At the moment of being exiled, Auriel was directly separated from him. She disappeared directly from Frostmourne, and even her rope of hope was taken away. When he went back, Frostmourne was now empty. It seemed that the moment he entered the void, the power of the void completely separated the two.

Putting away Frostmourne, in the system space that still can be use, but because there is nothing around, Roy can feel that his magic power is slowly radiating and draining around, not only magic power, but those on his body that are invisible to the naked eye. Yes, the cells of the body are also slowly spreading from the entire body surface into the void. The substances emitted from these bodies, after touching the void, also disappear out of thin air, as if they never existed.

This kind of dissipation, to be precise, should be some kind of replacement process, because the void is nothingness, and the process of dissipation is that the void replaces Roy with it little by little...

This situation is completely different from when the world of Devil May Cry repaired the cracks and touched the void. At that time, it was probably because of the large area of ​​contact with the material world, so the void at that time was violent and dangerous, but now it is Roy is in the void, and the contact area of ​​matter is small, so the erosion of the void appears much quieter, and it feels quite silent.

Of course, Roy couldn't let his substance just dissipate in the void, so he tried to use his magic power to stop this dissipating.

Contrary, it's actually really useful. When the magic power is spread all over the body, the magic power will be dissipated, and the cells of the self will stop dissipating.

But if you think about it carefully, this is not a long-term solution, because there is no substance in the void, and when there is no element around, the magic power cannot be replenished. If this continues, the magic power will always be used up.

Judging from the speed of dissipation, this time may take a long time, but once the magic power is completely exhausted and there is no substitute, then it will be completely unable to resist the erosion of the void, and can only carry it with one's own body.

In the end, it may completely turn into a part of the void...

Realizing that this would not work, Roy could only turn his body into a chaotic state. In fact, when the Devil May Cry world faced the void, Roy found that the erosion of the void was useless to him in the chaotic state!

At the moment of switching to the chaotic state, Roy's entire body became the only order field in this void, because Roy had all the elemental particles in the chaotic state. After these elemental particles reached certain conditions, they began to use Based on Roy's body, he has entered into a self-circulation. Under this condition, Roy's magic power can be supplemented again.

The previous time was just a guess, but this time it was completely confirmed that the chaotic state is the only state that can resist the erosion of the void!

After there was no problem with his own safety, Roy heaved a sigh of relief and began to try to explore this void.

In fact, because the devil children scattered in the High Heaven are related to Roy himself, this is a system creation after all, and the attribute definition given by Roy can't even completely erase the isolation of the void. Tt is only possible Because he is in the depths of the void, this connection has become very weak now.

Although it is weak, it also means that Roy still holds the coordinates of the material world. As long as he finds a way to walk in the void and find a place closer to the material world, he can sacrifice an Imp to let exchanges Imp position with his own, so that he can return to the material world.

This is the way to escape from the void. In fact, it is not just him, other people who have been exiled to the void can also return through a similar method. Of course, the premise is that they can also have a way to hold the void like Roy. Having the ability to Fight Erosion and the ability to "swim" from the depths of the void back to the fringes of the material world with the loss of all senses...

It's not easy to do this. There is no sense of direction in the void. You don't know whether you are advancing or retreating in the void, whether you are swimming towards the material world, or swimming deeper into the void. What is is this? It is impossible to say for sure, coupled with the fact that he has been eroded by the power of the void, the shadow and crisis of this slow death has always been shrouded in his head, and there are very few who can really hold on.

So far, in the world of Sanctuary, or the world of Diablo, there is only one recorded case that has returned from the void, and that is Lilith!

No one knows what method Lilith came back through, but there is a precedent for her return, so the archangels of the High Heaven did not take the method of exile in the void against their old rivals, the Seven Demon Kings, Instead, he chose to use the dark soul stone for soul imprisonment.

As for Roy, if Auriel had not seen the 'miracle' of exile through her authority, Tyrael and Itherael would not have used this method. It's useless to Roy, the only way to cause trouble for Roy is to exile...

I have to say that this is really Roy's only weakness right now, or as long as it is a creature from an alien world, exile is their common weakness, even in a man-made world like Sanctuary, even if the world itself is more exclusive Small, but with an inherently weak connection to the world with alien creatures, which is why the exile was able to succeed.

This is actually an "anchor point" theory, which is not too unusual.

Although he has been exiled now, Roy is not too worried. Unlike other exiled creatures, Roy completely resisted the erosion of the void in the state of chaos, and he became the only substance that can move freely in the void. This naturally gave Roy the opportunity to explore the void and he didn't intend to give up this opportunity. It was rare to enter the void once. Of course, he didn't want to go back so quickly. He flapped his wings and flew in the void.

Due to the lack of external perception, Roy didn't know where he was flying towards the void. He could only walk aimlessly. Even though there was no concept of distance in the void, he didn't know what he was flying like this. Really fly away, or stay in place.

It must be boring and useless to do this, so after a while, Roy stopped.

He realized that it was impossible for him to explore the void like this. He didn't even know how big the void was. Flying down like this was just a waste of time. He had to find a way to restore his perception in the void.

After thinking about it, Roy opened the system interface again.

To be honest, since becoming a chaotic demon, Roy has rarely used the system interface to improve his strength, because his own chaotic power has given him enough combat power, but now facing the situation of the void, Roy has It is necessary for Roy to carry out another "evolution"!

Yes, Roy did not choose to make any item this time, but chose to perform an evolution, he added an eye to himself, a huge eye!

On Roy's chest, a peculiar ocular feature was positioned. A vertical row of thorns adorned the middle of his chest, capable of parting to reveal a massive eyeball at the center. Unlike his previous third eye, this particular ocular manifestation took the form of a pure black crystalline sphere, brimming with an eerie presence.

[Eye of the Void]

This is the name that Roy named his newly added eyeball. Roy set that when this eyeball is opened, he can obtain a unique "Void Vision" in the void environment, so that he can observe the situation in the void.

This eye of the void can also absorb a certain amount of void power in the void and store it in the eyeball separately. This is set up by Roy for the convenience of studying void power in the future. Void power is a very dangerous power, but since Roy can fight against it, then it is not too dangerous in Roy's eyes. Preserving a certain amount of void power can avoid tearing apart the barriers of the material world in order to study the void in the future.

After the setup is complete, the rest is to pay the soul for the realization. Originally, Roy thought that this would consume a lot of his soul reserves, but what he didn't expect was that Roy was done by paying only 10,000 souls. In reality, this number can be said to be very small.

After the realization was completed, Roy's body changed immediately, but what Roy did not expect was that because he was in a state of chaos at the moment, the Eye of the Void was also alienated when it appeared. Roy's misty body At his chest, there appeared a vortex that kept stirring slowly. A ray of light generated out of thin air appeared straight in the middle of the vortex. After a part of it shot out, the rest dissipated, as if it was cut off. This picture is very similar to Some sci-fi pictures of black holes absorbing light.

But no matter what, when the Eye of the Void appeared, Roy was finally able to "see" things, and he saw the changes in his body for the first time, and he was also amazed at this alienation.

Raising his head, Roy looked around, and he also saw things in this void.

The first thing that caught my eye was the figure of Archangel Auriel!

What Roy didn't expect was that her position in the void was not far from where Roy was...
