# 531 - Deformed Child

In this starry sky, Roy looked so small, and when he was looking around, Trag'Oul is voice sounded again.

"Welcome to my dreamland, Osiris, the Demon King!"

With this voice, among the distant stars, hundreds of bright stars can be seen shining at the same time. If these shining stars are connected with each other by lines, you will find that they form a constellation, a huge constellation, a constellation circling like a long dragon!

"Dreamland? Are all the dreams of your Star Soul Titans like this?" Roy sighed and remarked, "Honestly, even though I am now capable of soaring through space and venturing beyond the confines of our world, I have yet to truly do so. Nonetheless, I appreciate the opportunity you've given me to experience it... However, I must say that your dream somewhat distorts the depiction of actual space. The scale of such a vast expanse is completely off!"

Roy gestured as he spoke. He pointed to the huge sun next to him and the planet under his feet and said, "If you can see such a huge sun, it means that the planet's position is very close to the sun. If this is the case, this planet It has already burned into a big fireball... It seems that you have not really left the planet and observed it outside the world, otherwise, you would not have made such a mistake!"

Roy said that it seems that Trag'Oul is the star soul titan, is not fully mature.

After hearing Roy's words, Trag'Oul didn't say anything, but in the next second, the huge sun was pulled away by a lot. It seemed that Trag'Oul was correcting his mistakes in time, or in other words, he was adjusting his right attitude. Cognition outside the world...

This is his dream and everything Roy sees here comes from Trag'Oul is cognition...

"Well, although I don't know what method you used to pull me into your dream, what are you going to do next?" Roy asked curiously, "Are you attacking me?"

"You're right!" Trag'Oul is voice sounded and at the same time, the shining dragon-shaped constellation in the distance also emitted light. A huge dragon-shaped phantom began to appear based on the constellation. The bodies that spread tens of thousands of kilometers are twisted and entangled together, forming a wriggling picture.

A strange-looking dragon head slowly lifted up, covered by countless tentacles, so that people couldn't see Trag'Oul's appearance at all. Only his pair of eyes hidden in the tentacles began to shine.

The next second, countless stars in the distance turned into sharp spears and shot at Roy densely.

Roy frowned and found that he couldn't dodge such a large-scale attack at all, so he could only condense a black ice wall in front of him, intending to block the attacks of these star spears, but when he tried to use his magic power to condense the ice wall, Roy found that I couldn't make it at all!

Just after such a delay, the spear of starlight that was shot quickly pierced through Roy's body!

The intense pain struck, making Roy's face twisted. He looked at his body and found that the dense holes in his body were slowly recovering.

"Illusion? I'm not actually injured?" Roy thought about it "But this pain is real. If it's a hallucination, why didn't I wake up with the stimulation?"

He couldn't use his power just now, what's going on?

Roy thought to himself that there must be some strange rules in Trag'Oul is strange dream.

But obviously, as Roy's opponent, Trag'Oul isn't explain anything for him. In those movies, the villain is beeping at the protagonist and showing off his ability in general, it will not happen in real life. Once again, countless condensed starlight spears and shot at Roy from a distance. Every time he attacked, he pierced countless holes in Roy's demon body, causing him severe pain, but these injuries Always recover slowly.

Roy didn't sit still. He tried to switch to other powers, trying to block Trag'Oul is attack, but without exception, he failed. All his elemental powers that had undergone mutation could not be used here.

After the last test for a while, Roy found that it was pure elemental power that could still be used!

"What is this situation?" Roy furrowed his brow and pondered, "Considering the previous event where the sun was pulled away, could it be that in this dream, all forms of power beyond Trag'Oul's understanding are rendered impossible to manifest?"

After considering it for a moment, Roy braced himself for another round of Trag'Oul's attack. Then, he suddenly addressed Trag'Oul, saying, "You know, the light of a star often takes a significant amount of time to reach a planet due to the vast distances between them and the fixed speed of light."

As soon as the words left his mouth, the starlight spears launched by Trag'Oul came to a sudden halt!

To be more precise, they didn't completely stop but instead slowed down significantly. They continued their trajectory from Trag'Oul's position in the distance, but their progress towards Roy's body was far from imminent.

Witnessing this phenomenon, Roy was taken aback and finally grasped the truth.

"Trag'Oul" Roy shouted loudly, "You, who are in the cradle, know the universe only from your imagination, right?"

Trag'Oul didn't deny it either, saying, "Yes, in this dream, everything beyond my cognition cannot be manifested, but in the same way, if you say something, it can also change my cognition!"

"Can all words be changed?" Roy asked curiously.

"No, there is only truth!" Trag'Oul said "If you want to talk nonsense, then don't play this kind of cleverness!"

Roy was stunned when he heard it and then said funnily "Ha, so, you are actually acquiring 'knowledge' from me? Then how do you judge that this 'knowledge' is correct?"

"Talent!" Trag'Oul said simply "This is the talent of the Star Soul Titan! We can perceive the 'truth'!"

"Is the Star Soul Titan so awesome?" Roy was also a little confused, he understood, which means that if there is a correct language in line with the rules of the world in what he said, then Trag'Oul get information about this Part of the 'knowledge' of world rules.

Is this a good thing for Roy? No, not so!

He tried to condense a fireball, a pure elemental fireball, and then smashed it to where Trag'Oul is. As a result, he saw that the fireball was flying forward, but he wanted to fly to where Trag'Oul is. It can be said that It's a long way off, because in the sentence just now, after Trag'Oul recognized the concepts of 'light speed' and 'planet distance', it means that its entire dream has been changed. This change is not only for Trag'Oul, It is also effective for Roy. The distance between Trag'Oul and Roy is too far, and the Starlight Spear cannot shoot at Roy's position in a short time, so in the same way, any attack from Roy should not hit Trag'Oul. Oh!

Unless Trag'Oul make the initiative to bring the distance closer...

But Roy also saw that Trag'Oul had a judgment on his own strength. He might feel that he was not Roy's opponent, so he did not seek to fight Roy at close range. Even Roy's injury just now The ability to recover is only based on his judgment and cognition of Roy.

He thinks that he may not be as powerful as Roy, so the Starlight Spear's attack on Roy is not fatal. At the same time, he also knows that demons have amazing recovery capabilities, so Roy's physical injuries can also be recovered, but for this This kind of resilience, Trag'Oul may not have a clear understanding, so it seems much slower.

Obviously, Trag'Oul should belong to a certain "deformed child"! Because he is a star-soul titan born in an artificial world, the star-soul titan born in this way is definitely different from other normal star-soul titan! This is because the rules of the man-made world are different from those of the natural world!

The power of the Star Soul Titan originates from the very fabric of the world, and in the case of Sanctuary, it was shaped and influenced by Inarius and Lilith through the Worldstone. It is likely that they altered the fundamental rules regarding Sanctuary, allowing for various phenomena to exist, such as the presence of numerous Nephalem beings.

Angels and demons, even if they are combined with each other, are difficult to give birth to offspring. This has long been proved in other worlds. In order to create offspring, Inarius and Lilith must have made relevant modifications, which led to them being able to have children, also the next child. Not only them, but also the angels and demons who hid together in the world of Sanctuary, were also united under this rule to give birth to offspring.

The children of Inarius and Lilith, as well as the children of other angels and demons combined, and these offspring combined with each other. This is the reason why the Nephalems truly become a race.

Moreover, this revised rule can continue to be adjusted. In order to suppress the power of the Nephalem, Inarius adjusted the frequency of the World Stone and the Nephalem became possible.

It is precisely because of such strange rules that Trag'Oul is the star-soul titan, difficult to mature. The power of the star-soul titan comes from knowledge and truth. They become powerful through cognition of the world and knowledge. This kind of rule adjustment obviously affected Trag'Oul is growth.

All the cognition of truth, if known by Trag'Oul, will make his power stronger and make his more difficult to deal with, but if he doesn't tell his knowledge, Roy can only be in his deformity. Under the information, using the same kind of deformed knowledge to fight Trag'Oul is like a paradox...

After Roy figured this out, he only felt an unprecedented headache. Star Soul Titans are all powerful perverts. Roy was already mentally prepared, but he never thought it would be like this.

After understanding this, Roy began to think about how to break the game...
