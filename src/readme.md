## Synopsis

Roy's life was nothing special. The only thing commendable was the last few moments when he saved a mother and her child from a drunk driver.

It's really an egg! Damn it, what kind of monster have I become? Did I fall into Hell instead of making it to Heaven??

Join Roy as he ventures through various worlds with the Custom Made Demon King Systemâ€”a system that allows Roy to draw anything he can imagine and create it through exchanging souls!
