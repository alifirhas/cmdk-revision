After showing his current strength a little bit, Roy felt very satisfied, so he refocused his attention on separating the two purgatory spaces.

Roy's chaotic body effectively neutralized the emerging void power from the void rift. As a result, the void rift became devoid of its destructive influence following the evolution of Roy's bloodline, and it sealed shut once again. With this development, Roy no longer needs to concern himself with the risk of reopening the void rift in his subsequent endeavors.

With a bit of force, the two fused purgatory spaces are forcibly torn apart along their boundary. Gradually, the two purgatory spaces got separated. Having reached this crucial stage, Roy's mission is essentially accomplished. All that remains is to allow some time for the two purgatory spaces to revert to their original positions, seamlessly enveloping the human world within the two realms and restoring the world to its former completeness.

While Roy separated the two purgatory spaces, the various weird phenomena that appeared in the human world on both sides completely disappeared. People can no longer see the projection of angels and demons, nor can they see the scene of the two fighting each other and didn't have to worry about falling into the space cracks and entering the dangerous purgatory space anymore.

Undoubtedly, the aftermaths of this event are indelible. Throughout the human world, ordinary human cognition and established perspectives undergo a swift and profound subversion within a short amount of time. This spectacle is witnessed by the masses and cannot be dismissed as mere hallucination. It is like an array of peculiar religions will emerge in the human world, each attempting to comprehend and interpret the inexplicable events that unfolded. The rise of these religions is destined to impact scientific progress in the human world, precipitating significant consequences.

But these have nothing to do with Roy, he is ready to return to the Abyss.

In fact, after separating the two purgatory spaces, Roy originally wanted to enter the human world. He want to see the human world where Bayonetta was, but unfortunately, when he tried to enter the human world, he was met with an unprecedented huge rebound.

It's fine as long as Roy stays in the purgatory space, but that's not the case in the human world. It didn’t feel obvious at first, but the rejection of Roy - the demon king, in the main world of Bayonetta and the others was unprecedentedly fierce. The moment Roy tried to enter, it seemed like the whole world's power was concentrated to reject Roy.

The strength of this blow, if it had to describe it, would not be less than millions of tons of strength...

In the face of the world’s repulsive effect, even if Roy used the power of the gods and authority, he was also rejected. The main world held incomparably deep malice against a powerful demon like Roy and would never allow him to enter that restricted area.

To be frank, Roy found himself somewhat perplexed by the situation. He was well aware of the challenges that a Demon King faced in entering the mortal realm, but he had not anticipated it to be this challenging.

"Ugh..." Roy grumbled with reluctance, muttering to himself, "If I don't have to go, I won't go. Do you think I want to go that badly?"[^2]

With that said Roy couldn't help but think of Rodin. That guy is Mephisto's clone, but he can stay in the human world. From this point of view, there is actually a way for Roy to go to the main world. You only need to create a clone with a lower power level and send it to the main world.

But Roy would not do this. He is now cautious about creating clones and will never create clones if it's not necessary. Even if Roy created clones, ROy must ensure that the clones can be completely under his control.

After thinking about it, Roy stopped his thought, and greeted Julia, Sparda and the others "Let's go back to the Demon World!"

After Roy and Sparda disappeared into the space channel, Jeanne and Bayonetta, who were still in heaven, breathed a sigh of relief. Roy tried to enter the human world before. It really shocked the two of them. Fortunately, the rules of the world they were in were still very complete, which prevented Roy's actions. Otherwise, the two really didn't know what to do.

"Hey, come to think of it, you did it!" Jeanne playfully nudged Bayonetta's waist and remarked, "Back when you entered into that power contract with Osiris, I was worried if it would make him even more formidable afterward."

"Indeed!" Bayonetta stretched out her hand to hold the black-framed glasses, and said "This is equivalent to keeping a stronger card at a lower price!"

[^1] Jeanne raised her head and looked into the distance. Some ancient angels were appearing in and they were approaching them. Seeing this scene, Jeanne jokingly said "At this point, the angels and The demon are no different!"

"Isn't it?" Bayonetta turned the two red guns with both hands and said "As soon as the Great demon left, they came over. It seems that the lesson is still not enough..."

The two beautiful young ladies look at each other. With a charming smile, the next second, the sound of endless gunfire sounded again, allowing golden blood and feathers to float in the heavenly sky again...

On the other side, Roy, who returned to the Demon World, took a deep breath and said to Sparda, "The air here is much more refreshing!"

"The holy light of heaven is unfriendly to the demon..." Sparda agreed.

"But there is still a difference between the Demon World and the Abyss!" Roy said, "Sparda, are you sure you want to stay here, don't you go back to the Abyss... with me?"

Sparda shook his head and said, "This is my second hometown. All my descendants are here. They are all children of taboo. If I go back to the Abyss World, I will definitely be targeted!"

"With me protecting you, what are you afraid of?" Roy sniffed.

"Thank you for your solicitation, Your Majesty!" Sparda bowed to Roy and said, "I can guard the Demon World for you, but it really won't work to return to the abyss..."

"The Demon World here doesn't make any sense to me!" Roy shook his head and said, "I don't intend to be king here. This Demon World has been isolated from the abyss for too long and has become a system of its own."

Sparda's words to Roy resonated with unwavering pride and reverence for their Abyss's bloodline, so he didn't dare to speak. As everyone knows, Roy has no interest in this world, no matter how vast the demon world is, it has limited space and didn't connect to the spatial channel of the Ten Thousand Realms just like the Abyss.

It is worth nothing compare to the Abyss! For Roy, the Demon World here can only be regarded as a third-tier or fourth-tier city. Where can there be a first-tier big city like Abyss?

After gaining a Mobius Mark, being promoted to the rank of Demon King, and successfully evolving into Chaos Demon, Roy’s past insecurity has been eliminated a lot. He knows that from now on, there are not many things that can threaten his life. After the insecurity is eliminated, it is replaced by the desire to explore the unknown.

Does the abyss world have an end? How many realms does it connect? Where are the other archangels and demon kings? What is High Heaven like? Does the creator of the angel and demon Titan truly exist? What's the matter with the void?

After becoming a demon, Roy also accepted his identity. As a human being, his life was short, but as an immortal species like a demon, he has endless time. If he doesn’t do anything, how can he pass this long time?

So many unknowns aroused Roy's curiosity, and he can't wait to explore now.

It’s fine if Sparda doesn’t accept his solicitation. Anyway, Madame Styx and the others, the demon lord, have been recruited by Roy. It doesn’t make any difference whether one more Sparda or one less Sparda, so he waved his hand and Roy stopped talking. Roy led everyone into the gate of the Abyss.

Seeing the demons follow Roy one by one, the four Sparda didn't know what they were thinking.

Sareth seemed to have thought about it, so he deliberately fell behind and said to Dante at the end "Dante, Nero, are you going to re-seal this abyss entrance?"

Dante glanced at Sparda, nodded and whispered "Yes, as long as this entrance still exists, there will always be demons from the abyss world entering the demon world again. We cannot guarantee that every demon that comes in will be righteous like your Foster Father and can communicate friendly..."

Nero also said "Although I don't want to admit it, Sparda... Grandpa did lie to your foster father..."

"Heh, foster father won't care!" Sareth waved his hand and said, "Otherwise, he would have taken you away forcibly. I just think that maybe you can keep a little back door when you seal the entrance, at least, Let me come and play with you!"

"Look for us to play?" Dante and Nero looked at each other in surprise.

"Yes!" Sareth nodded and pointed to Dante. "Although you always mess my hair, it's fun to be with you, I think we are friends?"

Dante laughed, squatting down and looking at Sareth and then stretched out his hand to signal Sareth. Sareth also understood in seconds, so a big hand and a small hand were squeezed together.

"Yes, we are friends!" Dante said "We will leave a way for you. As you child of taboo, you should be able to easily travel between the abyss and the demon world. Next time, I will treat you to food. Strawberry milkshake!"

"It's a deal!" Sareth smiled, turned and ran directly into the gate of the abyss.

Seeing Sareth leaving, Vergil stepped forward and said to the people with some doubts "In fact, I have always had a question, is Osiris we encountered this time really a demon? I have never heard of it. Which demon will help us stabilize the world and his righteous son is such a child of taboo son with a good personality... I feel surprised no matter how you think about it..."

"I don't know, I can't say it!" Sparda sighed "But maybe he just feels good because of his smooth promotion? Don't use our minds to guess the moody behavior of the demon king... Demon King is a Demon king, no matter how they behave..."

After the grandfather and grandson stayed silent for a while, they took out their magic swords together and began to seal the channel of the abyss and the demon world...

This also means that Roy's journey in these two twin worlds has come to an end...
