# 493 - What Lilith See Back Then?

Benia was right. If Julia rushed forward just now, maybe Roy and she would perish together. Fortunately, Benia stop Julia before it happens.

Frankly speaking, the sudden appearance of the void at this particular moment caught Roy by surprise. It diverged from Benia's comprehension of the void's power. According to Roy's understanding, the void isn't capable of swiftly eroding an entire world. Although his method of tearing apart the two spatial bubbles may be somewhat crude, the outcome remains the same.

Void power is a chaotic and violent force dedicated to turning the material world into nothingness. It is the common enemy of all material worlds. It sounds terrible but in essence...

The void forces that Roy has encountered and experienced take shape as creatures or objects that corrode and taint the material world. These infected entities expedite the process of destruction, exacerbating the downfall of the material realm. Even in the Darksiders World, the vastness of the void within the Demon King City gradually consumes the space it occupies, rather than obliterating it all at once. This demonstrates the unique and relentless potency of such power. Truly awe-inspiring!

It is precisely because of this special inertia that most of the world can exist safely.

The void is like a piece of paper or a blackboard. Thousands of worlds and the universes and spaces that contain them are all depicted on this background board. Only when the universe and space of the world appear or only when it is damaged can you see the black on the background board, exposing the existence of the void.

These thoughts raced through Roy's mind in a fleeting moment, causing him to refrain from succumbing to panic. Instead, he swiftly marshaled the magic power within his entire being, fortifying himself against the encroaching void forces. Simultaneously, Roy utilized Mobius Mark to closely observe the swarming entities of the void.

There is no doubt that the power of the void, like black lightning, is now trying to corrode him. By infecting the creatures of the material world, the power of the void can survive in the material world. If Roy is corroded, then he will immediately be transformed into a void creature, even if he is already a demon king. He will become a void lord and directly swallow these two twin worlds...

Fortunately, this erosion did not happen overnight, which naturally gave Roy a chance to breathe.

Roy now faces two choices. One is to give up and continue to separate the two purgatory spaces, and immediately escape and return directly to the abyss world, but the consequence of doing so is that this void fissure will never be closed, and it will continue to spray. Void power emerged, corrupting and eroding the two purgatory spaces, and then continued to spread to the human world.

An alternative course of action entails enduring the erosion caused by the void forces and expeditiously restoring the two purgatory spaces to their original states. By doing so, the tempestuous space storm can be pacified, and the torn void rift will gradually mend, effectively sealing off the influence of the void forces. However, it is crucial to recognize that choosing this path entails potential risks. If Roy proves incapable of withstanding the corrosive nature of the void power, he runs the risk of succumbing to corruption.

As a demon, you don't even have to think about it. It's the first choice. Roy also thinks that his safety is first and there is no need to carry it out for these two worlds.

However, just when he was about to withdraw and evacuate, suddenly, Roy found that all the magic loops on his body were pulsing.

With a move in his heart, Roy temporarily stopped his intention to evacuate and quickly began to carefully perceive the magic circuit in his body.

He hasn't forgotten what Lilith once said, only the power of chaos can fight the power of the void!

During his time in the Abyss world, Roy has been thinking about this issue. He thinks that Lilith’s words have a reason. If the void power represents "nothing", then the elemental power represents "thing"!

Amidst the plethora of magical theories, one fundamental principle remains: the elements serve as the foundation of the material world. This recognition is true, regardless of the uniqueness of any given material—it remains intricately connected to the evolution of the elements. While a solitary element may merely signify a fragment of the material world, the ability to unite all the elements signifies the embodiment of a complete material realm. It is within this theoretical framework that the basis for chaotic power finds its roots.

However, things like chaotic power may be easy to separate, but it is more difficult to regroup together. Roy has been trying to fuse these circuits since he opened up the magic circuits of all elements. But Roy himself didn't know what went wrong. He can now use various element magic alone or cast some mixed element magic, but he has never been able to use all the element magic.

For so many years, there has been no progress, which made Roy have some doubts about whether the so-called Chaos Force truly exists.

Only at this moment, when Roy was accidentally exposed to a void in the rift and was corroded by the power of the void, did he suddenly understand all the previous things!

[^1] During Roy's time in the world of Darksiders, he was merely a high-ranking demon. Although his strength improved rapidly when considering the lifespan of a demon, it still paled in comparison to Lilith, the demon king. In her eyes, his power was insignificant.

Nevertheless, Lilith not only bestowed her attention upon Roy but also entrusted him with a heavy responsibility—the mission to retrieve the Red Sea egg. What's more, Lilith also explained the concept of Chaos Demon to Roy in a great mood.

At that time Roy didn't think much when he arrived, but now looking back, Roy suddenly discovered that Lilith did this deliberately!

Lilith, in many legends, is a very special existence. She is the first female demon in the Abyss world and the ancestor of the succubus family. Not only does she maintain a close relationship with all the demon kings, but she also has a relationship with Angles. It is said that Demon King Samael used to be an angel. It was precisely because of his marriage to Lilith that he left the Garden of Eden and came to the abyss world to become a demon.

She is considered to be the first wife of the ancestor Adam of mankind. She is Eve, but she left the Garden of Eden because of dissatisfaction with Adam and later became a female demon who seduced humans and strangled babies.

Even in some human folklore, she is the ancestor of vampires, the origin of vampires...

There are so many features that make it impossible to distinguish what kind of existence Lilith is. However, as far as Roy understands, Lilith in the Darksiders world is undoubtedly very powerful, because she has the power to control time!

Roy was very suspicious for a time. When Lilith saw herself, did she see something in the long river of time? so she liked herself so much...

Now, what was once mere suspicion has transformed into unwavering conviction. Roy has made a startling revelation: under the overwhelming onslaught of the void power's erosion, every magic circuit within his body has begun to rebel. Simultaneously, the elemental powers residing within these magic circuits have exhibited unmistakable signs of fusion.

Not a fusion of one or two, but a fusion of all elements!

It's no wonder that when Roy tried on his own in the past, he couldn't integrate all the elements. It turned out to be a lack of special environmental conditions...

Roy no longer intends to run away. He knows that such an opportunity is simply a huge opportunity of a lifetime. The void rifts exposed are not huge, and the power of the void that swarms out has not reached the point where it is completely irresistible. Once he misses it, he may never encounter such unique environmental conditions again.

With unwavering determination, Roy clenched his teeth and hold himself, urging the magic circuit within his body to function relentlessly. Despite enduring excruciating, maddening pain that seemed to tear him apart, he paid it no heed. Instead, a glimmer of fervor gleamed in his eyes, reflecting his unwavering fanaticism.

"Come on! Lilith!" Roy muttered to himself with difficulty "If you saw what happened to me in the long river of time, then it means that I must have a chance of success! Otherwise, you wouldn't have said those things to me in the first place!"

Roy doesn’t quite understand what the picture seen by Lilith, a prophet who can observe the future looks like, but it should be countless possibilities. Just like Doctor Strange in thousands of possibilities.

Just as he found the only option that could defeat the Purple Sweet Potato Spirit, Roy felt that Lilith must have seen a similar picture, having successfully defeated the erosion of the void and gained the power of chaos.

What Roy has to do is make this picture a reality!

Black lightning shrouded Roy's body, violently radiating a terrifying and distorted scene around him. The Sparda in the distance had already been stunned at this moment. They could no longer see Roy's figure, he could only see a huge black plasma ball floating there, endless auras of madness and destruction, constantly permeating from this black ball, even the ubiquitous soft holy light in the heavens was swept away by these auras.

"If... I mean if..." Dante swallowed hard, and said, "If Osiris is swallowed by some void power, does it mean the end is coming?"

"Yes!" Benia glanced at him and said indifferently "Doom! Everything in you and me, us, and even these two twin worlds will be completely erased, in the universe and the world, There will be no more information about us, as if it never existed..."

"That's bad news!" After listening to Sareth, his face was horrified. He couldn't imagine the scene at all. He could only use such a word to describe his current mood.

Benia rubbed Sareth's head and comforted him "Don't worry, at least when we disappear, it may not hurt too much, and we will disappear in a blink of an eye..."
