# 491 - Power Contract

Julia retrieved the origin of her soul and Roy also successfully obtained Mobius Mark. His purpose of coming to this world this time has been achieved, and it can even be said to be over-fulfilled.

Roy is not very familiar with the control of authority now, so he can't wait to return to the Abyss. For him, Sparda and Dante's worries are completely unnecessary.

"Don't look at me like that!" Roy said to Sparda "This is the heaven purgatory space, so the situation is fine. Once I enter the human world, even if I don't want to leave, the world will not allow it!"

Hearing Roy's words, Sparda heaved a sigh of relief and nodded "I hope you don't mind, Osiris... Your Majesty! After all, I have been in the human world for a long time. To me, the human world here is equivalent to the first two hometowns, I don’t want it to be hurt..."

Roy was in a good mood at the moment, so he smiled jokingly "Hmph, don't worry about that. But without me, those guys in the Demon World would be ruled by no one, right?"

Sparda looked suffocated and smiled bitterly "That's for sure. Several demon lords are dead. Madam Styx and the others may follow you back to the abyss world. After losing the leader, the demons who come from Abyss will take the opportunity to gain power and territory. The Demon World will probably be in chaos for a while."

"Old man, please seal off the Demon World again!" Dante exclaimed suddenly, standing next to Roy.

However, Virgil interjected, "It's futile, Dante. Haven't you realized? Even if the Demon World were to be completely sealed, there will always be individuals in the human world who seek to break that seal."

Dante snorted and choked back "The person you are talking about is you, right?"

The two brothers stared at each other and froze for a while, then turned their heads together and snorted.

Sparda took advantage of this gap and finally said "No need to seal it up, Dante and the others will be responsible for clearing away the demons that entered the human world..."

Not giving Sparda finish his argument, Sareth interjected while making a questioning expression beside Sparda "By the way, this decision you made was not because you didn't want your son to lose his job, right?"

Yes, Dante is a demon hunter. In case the Demon World is sealed and there is no invasion of the demon, Dante is afraid that he soon will be poor...

So when he heard this, Dante became a little irritated and grabbed Sareth, rubbing his red hair into a mess.

Roy doesn't comment on Sparda's decision. He couldn't control what the world would become after he left, so he turned his head to look at Bayonetta and Jeanne.

These two witches exuded an aura that made Roy perceive them as superior to even Sparda. After all, being the contractors, witches and demons held greater connections. Roy voiced his thoughts, saying, "Despite its ancient, this realm remains one of the kingdoms of heaven. It should maintain contact with the High Heaven. The fall of the archangel Jubileus must be a big event for the High Heaven. It's possible that in due time, a new archangel will be dispatched to this world. At that point, you witches will become prime targets. How do you intend to address this impending situation?"

Bayonetta had been looking at Roy's current appearance before, and now she immediately shook her head when she heard this, and said, "It's not easy for those angels to kill us. You don't need to worry about this, but... if you can, I hope to sign a contract with you, allowing me to borrow your power in this world."

"Oh!?" Roy asked with interest "So, what price are you willing to pay?"

With arms folded, Bayonetta declared, "The price is the soul of an upper-rank angel! Trust me, even for a witch who has been in contact with demons, finding a powerful demon like yourself is a rarity. If we can strike a contract, I assure you that every time I harness your power, I will offer you the souls of three upper-rank angels in return!'"

"Hm..." Roy rubbed his chin with his thick fingers, thinking for a while.

For Roy, the sacred soul of upper-rank angels is not very useful, because it can't satisfy his appetite. It even can't be absorbed or used to increase his magic power. He is different from those fanatical demons who take the job of destroying angels as his main mission. He lacks the sense of honor that belongs to the demon alone, but even if he can’t use it, the sacred soul of upper-rank angels is a valuable resource. Now Roy has reached a Demon King level, he is also considered the top class in the abyss world. This type of resource may be possible to be used to exchange good things with other demon kings.

"You have a deal!" Roy finally made a decision and said "I allow you to borrow my power in this world!"

The next thing is logical. Roy and Bayonetta signed a power contract. The content of the contract state that Bayonetta can only borrow Roy's power in this world and this borrowing is hierarchical. For each increment of power that Bayonetta borrows, equating to every tenth of the total, she is obligated to offer the souls of three upper-rank angels as sacrifices. These souls must be of a minimum rank of four-winged angels. Additionally, for every 100% increase in the borrowed power, the corresponding tribute of souls is doubled. It is crucial to note that Bayonetta must adhere to this sacrificial practice each time she borrows power from Roy.

If Bayonetta wants to borrow Roy's full power, then every time she borrows it, she needs to enshrine at least thirty sacred souls! This number is already a lot, even if the heavenly world here has a long history, it is difficult to gather so many four-winged angel souls...

Sparda and the others silently watched Bayonetta and Roy sign the contract and did not say much. Although they felt that it was dangerous for humans to borrow the power of the demon, especially the power of the demon king, it might bring harm to the world. This is, after all, the world where the witches reside, their true domain. There is nothing to do with the world of the two twin worlds. The connection between the two twin worlds lies mainly in the connection between the purgatory space. As long as the witches do not cross the boundary, there should be no problem.

Furthermore, they hold the belief that individuals like witches, who have engaged with demons extensively, possess an acute awareness of the perils associated with demonic power. Consequently, they should exercise heightened caution when dealing with such forces. The power was sealed through a contract between Bayonetta and Roy, perhaps serving as an additional safeguard to ward off potential angelic attacks and bolster their defenses.

At the moment when the power contract was signed, Roy felt the position of the contractor Bayonetta and the spatial connection with him. In other words, if Roy has studied space power a little deeper, maybe through this contractual connection, he can appear next to Bayonetta. Bypassing the detection of the will of the world and appearing in Bayonetta's world.

This is naturally a loophole in the rules, but unfortunately, Bayonetta knows the existence of such loopholes. As a witch who has signed power contracts with many demons, such loopholes is easy to find out, so Roy's feeling only lasted for a second or two and then disappeared in the next moment. He could no longer accurately perceive the spatial position of Bayonetta!

This may be caused by Bayonetta's use of a secret method unique to the witch...

Bayonetta and Roy signed a contract of power, but Jeanne did not. As Bayonetta's best friend, she felt that she should take precautions and not sign a contract with the same demon.

After dealing with these things, the most important thing left is to find a way to separate the two purgatory spaces that have gradually merged.

Whether it’s the heaven of Bayonetta’s world or the demon world of Dante’s world. The purgatory space of the two twin worlds was one before, but they cannot be one again. After all, they have been separated for so long. If it happens again, the fusion will have an enormous impact on the two twin worlds. Not to mention that the living space of angels and demons will be affected by each other, which will lead to the start of eternal war once again. Roy is afraid that it will run into unimaginable chaos.

Therefore, the utmost priority for Bayonetta and Dante lies in re-establishing the separation of the purgatory space between the two worlds. This time, the only individual capable of achieving this feat is Roy, the newly anointed Demon King.

Only with having authority similar to God, Demon Kings can achieve this feat. This is why they still gather around Roy, but they are most anxious now that Roy is not willing to do such troublesome things. After all, the demon they do is based on their liking...

Fortunately, Roy did not ignore it, because for him, separating the two fused purgatory spaces again is just one thing that can make him familiar with the power of "authority"...
