# 491 - Power Contract

Julia retrieved the origin of her soul, and Roy himself also successfully obtained the Eyes of the World and the Mobius Mark. His purpose of coming to this world this time has been achieved, and it can even be said to be over fulfilled.

Roy is not very familiar with the control of authority now, so he can't wait to return to the Abyss. For him, Sparda and Dante worries are completely unnecessary.

"Don't look at me like that!" Roy said to Sparda "This is the heavenly world, so the situation is fine. Once I enter the human world, even if I don't want to leave, the world will not allow it!"

Hearing Roy's words, Sparda heaved a sigh of relief and nodded "I hope you don't mind, Osiris... Your Majesty! After all, I have been in the human world for a long time. To me, the human world here is equivalent to the first Two hometowns, I really don’t want it to be hurt..."

Roy was in a good mood at the moment, so he smiled jokingly "Hmph, don't you worry, without me, those guys in the Demon World would be overwhelmed by no one?"

Sparda looked suffocated, and smiled bitterly "That's for sure. Several demon lords are dead. Madam Styx and the others may follow you back to the abyss world. After losing the leader, the demons who come from behind will take the opportunity to compete. Power and territory, the Demon World will probably be in chaos for a while."

"Old man, please seal the Demon World again!" Dante suddenly said next to him.

In the end, Virgil said first "It's useless, Dante, haven't you discovered it? Even if the Demon World is really sealed, there will always be people in the human world who will try to open the seal."

Dante snorted and choked back "The person you are talking about is you, right?"

The two brothers stared at each other and froze for a while, then turned their heads together and snorted.

Sparda took advantage of this gap and finally said "No need to seal it up, Dante and the others will be responsible for clearing away the demons that entered the human world..."

The voice hadn't fallen yet, and Sareth had a weird expression beside him "By the way, this decision you made was not because you didn't want your son to lose his job, right?"

Yes, Dante is a demon hunter. In case the Demon World is really sealed and there is no invasion of the demon, Dante is afraid that he will really be too poor...

So when he heard this, Dante became a little irritated and grabbed Sareth, rubbing his red hair into a mess.

Roy was noncommittal about Sparda's decision. He couldn't control what the world would become after he left, so he turned his head to look at Bayonetta and Jeanne.

These two witches actually gave Roy the feeling that they were better than Sparda. After all, as the contractors, the witches and demons have more connections. Roy said, "Even the ancient angels, here is the kingdom of heaven. It should also be in contact with the High Heaven. The archangel Jubileus has fallen. This is definitely a big event for the High Heaven. Maybe it won’t be long before a new angel archangel will be sent to you. Come to the world, you witches will definitely become the biggest targets by then. Do you have any thoughts on this?"

In fact, Bayonetta had been looking at Roy's current appearance before, and now she immediately shook her head when she heard this, and said, "It's not easy for those angels to kill us. You don't need to worry about this, but...if you can If you do, I hope to sign a contract with you, allowing me to borrow your power in this world."

"Oh!?" Roy asked with interest "So, what price are you willing to pay?"

"The price is the soul of a high-ranking angel!" Bayonetta said with her arms folded, "Trust me, even for a witch who has been in contact with the demon for a long time, a powerful demon like you is very difficult to meet, if you can be with you To reach a contract, I promise that every time I borrow your power, I will give you the souls of three upper rank angels to you!"

"Um..." Roy rubbed his chin with his thick fingers, thinking for a while.

For Roy, the sacred soul of high-ranking angels is not very useful, because it can't satisfy the appetite, and can't be used to absorb and increase the magic power. He is different from those fanatical demons who take the task of destroying angels as their own. He lacks the sense of honor that belongs to the demon alone, but even if he can’t use it, the sacred soul of upper rank angels is actually a resource. Now Roy has entered the Demon King level, he is also considered the top class in the abyss world. This type of resource may be possible. It might be used to exchange good things with other demon kings.

"Yes!" Roy finally made a decision and said "I allow you to borrow my power in this world!"

The next thing is logical. Roy and Bayonetta signed a power contract. The content of the contract stipulates that Bayonetta can only borrow Roy's power in this world, and this borrowing is hierarchical. Level, every tenth of the power, after borrowing once, Bayonetta must enshrine the souls of three upper rank angels, and these souls are at least four-winged angels, and the 100% higher the borrowed power, The corresponding worship will also be doubled.

If Bayonetta wants to borrow Roy's full power, then every time she borrows it, she needs to enshrine at least thirty sacred souls to Roy! This number is already a lot, even if the heavenly world here has a long history, it is difficult to gather so many four-winged angel souls...

Sparda and the others silently watched Bayonetta and Roy sign the contract, and did not say much. Although they felt that it was dangerous for humans to borrow the power of the demon or even the demon king, this is after all the world where the witches are and where they are. There is nothing to do with the world of the two twin worlds. The connection between the two twin worlds lies mainly in the connection between the purgatory space. As long as the witches do not cross the boundary, there should be no problem.

Moreover, they also believe that people like witches who have dealt with demons for a long time will not be unaware of the dangers of demons. They should be more cautious in dealing with demonic power. The power signed by Bayonetta and Roy. The contract, perhaps more to increase the hole cards, to prevent angels from attacking them...

Soon, the contract was completed. At the moment when the power contract was completed, Roy clearly felt the position of the contractor Bayonetta and the spatial connection with him. In other words, if Roy has studied space power a little deeper, and maybe through this contractual connection, he can appear next to Bayonetta, thus bypassing the detection of the will of the world, and appearing in Bayonetta's world in a special way. .

This is naturally a loophole in the rules, but unfortunately, Bayonetta obviously knows the existence of such loopholes. As a witch who has signed power contracts with many demons, such loopholes are It is easy to find out, so Roy's feeling only lasted for a second or two, and then disappeared in the next moment. He could no longer accurately perceive the spatial position of Bayonetta!

This may be caused by Bayonetta's use of a secret method unique to the witch...

Bayonetta and Roy signed a contract of power, but Jeanne did not. As Bayonetta's best friend, she felt that she should take precautions and not sign a contract with the same demon.

After dealing with these things, the most important thing left is to find a way to separate the two purgatory spaces that have gradually merged.

Whether it’s the heaven of Bayonetta’s world or the demon world of Dante’s world, the purgatory space of the two twin worlds was one before, but after all, they have been separated for so long. If it really happens again The fusion will have an enormous impact on the two twin worlds. Not to mention that the living space of angels and demons will be affected by each other, which will lead to a continuous and protracted battle. I am afraid that I will fall into unimaginable chaos.

Therefore, re-separating the purgatory space of the two worlds is the most important thing for Bayonetta and Dante.

And now the only thing that can do this is Roy, the newly promoted Demon King...

Only by standing shoulder to shoulder with the gods, can they do this with supreme mighty power. This is why they still gather around Roy, but they are most anxious now that Roy is not willing to do such troublesome things. After all, the demon does they really do based on their liking...

Fortunately, Roy did not really ignore it, because for him, separating the two fused purgatory spaces again is just one thing that can make him familiar with the power of "authority"...
