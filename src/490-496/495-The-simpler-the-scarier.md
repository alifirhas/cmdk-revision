# 495 - The simpler the scarier

Don't talk about nails, even the demon horns on Roy's head are gone in the fog.

It's like a middle-aged man suddenly starts to lose his hairs, even if he says something he doesn't care about it, he still tries all the hair growth products in private... It's a pain that was completely incomprehensible when he was young...

The same is true as a demon. Demon’s horns are a symbol of male demons. When the demon’s horns were still there, Roy could not help but rub them. The sense of comfort and security that comes is unparalleled.

But after suddenly discovering that the horns were gone, and there was only a misty fog on his head, Roy's mood was undoubtedly very anxious.

Along with the change in his mood, the mist on Roy's body suddenly became manic and restless, and the tumbling mist suddenly made the air around him become dignified.

Sparda and the others suddenly felt a strong sense of suffocation, and they only felt that the magic power in their bodies was suddenly blocked, and the magic power was almost unable to communicate with the surrounding elements.

This is even more true for Bayonetta and Jeanne. Amidst all the exclaims, the magic pattern under their feet used to float in the air suddenly disappeared, and the two of them suddenly fell from mid-air. if not for Dante quick reaction and immediately transformed into a sin demon form, and flew over, They may fall directly from the heavens back to the world...

"This... is the forbidden domain?" Surprise surged within Sparda's heart, nearly boiling over. While he understood that Roy's actions were unintentional, it was precisely this lack of control that made it all the more terrifying. The power unleashed by individuals when their emotions fluctuate can pose great challenges. What if they were to do it intentionally?

The fall of Bayonetta and Jeanne made Roy come back to his senses, realizing that their present situation is related to him, so he can only calm down and restrain his emotions.

Everyone felt a little better...

Roy found that since turning into this misty state, it seemed that he had acquired some special abilities, but it was not the time to explore these abilities at the moment, so he could only wait to return to the abyss world.

Julia and Benia were extremely excited, although Roy had become strange now, he really survived the erosion of the void. Not only that, they also noticed that the void in the void was slowing down. The ground is closed, and Roy does not have any void power remaining on his body, which shows that Roy not only defeated the void erosion, but even expelled the void power in turn!

This is an incredible thing...

"My dear, have you really become the Chaos Demon?" Julia wanted to hug Roy, but looking at his ethereal and illusory appearance, she didn't know how to hug him, so she could only ask curiously.

"I don't know if it's..." Roy replied. He has no mouth now, but the demon's words can still be "spoken", and that kind of puzzled tone echoes in the sea of ​​souls of everyone.

"Not sure?" Benia was also very curious. She flapped her wings and flew around Roy, observing the condition of his body. Gradually, Benia saw something and said in surprise [1] "My dear, you... how can these mists on your body be..."

Benia couldn't continue, because the changes in Roy's body really exceeded her cognition.

In fact, Roy also discovered that, combined with the changes in his pedigree in the system panel, the fog on him is actually composed entirely of elements.

But this element is not an element in the conventional sense...

They all say that they are indecisive, quantum mechanics! Since the birth of quantum theory in human science, this sentence has often been used to explain some incomprehensible phenomena. After all, for many people, quantum theory is very esoteric, and they think that quantum theory can explain everything.

But in fact, things like quantum are not too complicated. If a physical quantity has the smallest indivisible basic unit, the physical quantity is quantized, and the smallest unit is called quantum.

In other words, quantum is to subdivide a thing to the point where it can’t be subdivided, and its basics can’t be subdivided, from cells, cel to nuclei, nuclei to atoms, molecules, neutrons, protons, electrons... and so on. Until it can no longer be separated, that particle is the so-called quantum.

This is the cognition on the scientific side, and similarly, there is also the cognition on the mysterious side that the element is also a kind of particle. With magic as a medium and catalyst, the element particles can also be combined at will. Split.

Of course, the element particles in the mystery theory are not molecular atoms in the scientific side. It can be imagined as the particles formed by the aggregation of a variety of molecular atoms. They are called "elements". The name is different, but this kind of can be separated. The nature is the same as that of atoms and molecules.

So if the element particles are split until they can no longer be split, can they also be called quantum?

The answer is yes, Roy's current situation is because all the element magic circuits in the body are completely integrated. In order to be able to coexist with each other, they spontaneously split into the most basic element units! And even transformed Roy's body...

It can be said that Roy’s body is now composed of the most basic units of the elements. These strange and mysterious mists are composed of trillions of elemental quantum. Roy escaped because of Roy's soul and Mobius Mark pulling them.

The system panel refers to Roy’s state as a quantum demon for this reason. However, in the local name of the abyss demon, this form is called [Chaos Demon]...

Having said that, you may have guessed it, yes, it is precisely because all the elements are now in Roy's body in a quantum state, so Roy can indeed use any elemental magic without any hindrance. Because elemental quantum can be transformed into any elemental magic!

Moreover, any elemental magic that Roy uses now will automatically obtain the extremely effective effects of various elements. To sum it up in one sentence, any magic he uses now will be devastating!

After Roy explained his current state a bit, he demonstrated it to everyone on the spot.

Reaching out his index finger, which had no nails, Roy lightly nodded a distant space in front of him.

"freeze!"

Two simple words, as Roy's voice fell, the place he was pointing suddenly turned into a dark cube!

The darkness is so pure, but apart from that, there is no other vision. Compared with the magic used by Roy in the past, the effect is a bit simple and unpretentious. Such a dark cube stood there.

"Foster father, what have you done?" Sareth asked suspiciously.

The rest of the people also felt a little strange, feeling that Roy's attack just now was in great contrast to his weird form at the moment.

However, in the eyes of people who are more knowledgeable like Sparda and Benia, Roy's understatement just now is so terrible!

"Retreat, back away quickly!" Sparda pulled Dante and Virgil, and Benia also pulled Julia and Sareth, quickly hiding back.

Among the bewildered eyes of everyone, a squeaking sound suddenly came, and the dark cube suddenly began to split. This split does not refer to the split in the conventional sense, but refers to the space where the dark cube is located. It's cracked! This sound is the sound from the collapse of the space. It is not transmitted through the air, but directly appears in the sense consciousness of all people in this continuous space.

In the horrified eyes of everyone, the collapsed cubic space quickly shattered together to form a spherical shape. In the end, it seemed to be continuously squeezed, becoming smaller and smaller, and finally turned into a black spot. Disappeared.

"This...what's the situation!?" Sareth looked at Benia dumbfounded, hoping that Benia's mother could explain to him.

But before Benia could speak, Sparda took a deep breath, and said solemnly, "Your foster father... just frozen that space!"

"Oh, it's frozen..." Sareth just nodded, and suddenly reacted "Wait, what did you say, Uncle Sparda? The space is frozen!?"

"Yes!" Benia nodded, and took the conversation "Not only space, but also time is frozen, otherwise, there will be no such pure and terrible darkness! That is the sage of the kingdom of heaven. It is caused by the freezing of light. Without the movement and spread of light, we naturally can't see anything with the naked eye!"

"Absolute zero in the true sense??" Julia also reacted, covering her mouth slightly in surprise "Isn't that the effect Osiris has been pursuing? It's been too long before, why? Did it so easily now?"

"This is probably the power of the Chaos Demon... It's amazing." There was a light of excitement in Benia's eyes.

Roy flew over and nodded to the two of them "Indeed, absolute zero, the power that can freeze time and space together, the silence of all things, the temperature that ends everything, except for the power of the void and the power of authority. I am afraid that not many people can resist the move of the material world... If it were not for me to use the power of authority to limit the scope of the space to the cube, and after the space collapsed, let the rest of the space squeeze it into the void. If this is the case, I am afraid that the chain reaction caused can directly destroy the entire purgatory space of the heavenly kingdom... I did not expect to be able to do it so easily..."

Dante and Virgil, as well as Bayonetta and Jeanne, everyone was so silly to hear that they didn't expect that a simple blow could cause such terrible consequences. Fortunately, this one in front of you His Majesty the Demon King has no malice towards this world, otherwise...

"Foster father, you're so amazing, you're so handsome!" Sareth was already cheering.

And Julia is smiling, sighing in her heart. From the time Roy became a high-ranking demon and she knew her, she felt that Roy had always been better than the demon of the same rank. She did not expect that now after becoming the demon king, Still showing a more powerful force.

Such a powerful destructive force, even for the rest of the demon kings, it is not easy to achieve it, right?

## Change Notes

1. Here Benia says God, which kinda doesn't make sense for a demon
