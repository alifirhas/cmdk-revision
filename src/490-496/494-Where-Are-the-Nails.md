# 494 - Where are my nails?

When a wise life with profound wisdom is invaded by the void, it experiences intense agony and torment. This kind of pain and torture not only refers to the body but also refers to the soul.

The unceasing anguish intertwines with peculiar illusions, creating a sense of perpetuity. These illusions possess the uncanny ability to morph their scenery by the desires of those affected, often evoking intense happiness. Yet, just as swiftly, they can plunge one into the depths of despair, embracing the abyss. When all hope seems lost, they can abruptly induce ecstasy. In essence, these illusions relentlessly toy with the thoughts of sentient beings, relentlessly assaulting their will until it crumbles completely. Power thrives on exploiting vulnerability and emptiness.

In the beginning, Urgash the chaotic dragon of the heroic and invincible world, was tortured and mad. During his sleep and healing, the void power infected him. Although Urgash also resisted, in the long years, he Still declared lost, when Roy and the others left, Urgash had completely turned into a void creature, not only devouring the world of Ashan but also devouring the moon in the universe and the creation that healed in the moon. The Dragon of Asha.

Perhaps the existence of Ashan World can no longer be found in the Ten Thousand World. The spatial coordinates of that world are estimated to have become nothingness, leaving only a Void Lord Urgash entrenched there...

Roy’s situation now is very similar to the original Urgash. The body and soul have suffered maddening pain and torture at the same time. They may be able to resist it for a while, but if it takes a long time, Roy estimated that the twin world will also embark on the old road of Urgash.

Physical pain and torture can be sustained with willpower, but Roy can only rely on the power of the Mobius Mark to resist the pain and torture of the soul.

Deep within Roy's soul, he possesses the ability to manifest Mobius Mark—an eternal symbol of two intertwining serpents ceaselessly pursuing each other. With each revolution, a radiant halo of light emanates, dispelling the madness and darkness that lurk within the depths of his being. These opposing forces continually cycle back and forth, engaged in a perpetual dance of rivalry and harmony, as if locked in an eternal struggle for dominance.

Now Roy is extremely fortunate that he has integrated Mobius Mark and been promoted to the Demon King's rank before directly contacting the void power. This has given Roy the confidence to resist the erosion of the void at the soul level. This may also be the reason that Urgash was able to persist in this way. For a long time, Roy wondered for a time if he hadn't had this Eyes of the World, would he declare a failure in resistance the first time he was exposed to the power of the void, and then fall completely?

This kind of consequence makes me shudder when I think of it...

In a short period, Roy can still hold on, but not for a long time. Roy can only focus on the changes in the body as much as possible, hoping that he can complete the magic circuit before he completely collapses. Otherwise, all of this will be means nothing.

One day passed quickly, and then two days, three days, a full week, Roy was stuck in the void of the void, always fighting the erosion of the void.

In the past seven days, Roy’s location has become a forbidden zone. Julia, Benia, Sareth, Sparda, Dante, Virgil, Bayonetta, and Jeanne have been watching from a distance. They dispelled all the angels and demons still in this space and prevented any creatures from approaching here.

Fortunately, there is no need for them to disperse them. As long as the guys have existence, they can feel the terrifying aura from this area. Regardless of how huge their curiosity is in their hearts, the palpitation and desperate aura will also affect their curiosity. The heart is completely suppressed...

"It's been a week... Can Osiris succeed?" Sparda said worriedly, looking at the black spot in the center of the area.

But no one can answer his question. Only Dante put his arms around his shoulders and said "Look at it, old man, there is only so much we can do. If Osiris fails, it is nothing more than the destruction of the world. That's all, we can't escape, so we should eat and drink, get more nervous and wait for the result."

Sparda also knew that Dante was right. They really couldn’t do anything, so they could only sigh, “Oh, so I always think that the existence of this kind of out-of-specification in the world is not a good thing, because once something happens or there is any action, we can’t even stop him..."

However, before Sparda's voice could fade, an abrupt shift occurred in the central region!

The huge black ball that had covered the fissure position before had been slowly expanding towards the surroundings, but now it suddenly began to shrink back, and the density of the diffuse black electric glow suddenly began to shrink.

When everyone observed this scene, they were shocked and immediately flew toward the center.

When they came to a place more than a kilometers meters away from the location of the fissure, they stopped. At this moment, their vision became very clear. They were shocked to see that the eroding void force had indeed shrunk. But, an indescribable object appeared at the crack location!

A dense cloud of gray mist enveloped the surroundings, vaguely resembling the form of a human figure. Along the edges of this figure's outline, an unending swirl of mist continuously emanated and dissipated. The texture of this mist was far from light; instead, it possessed a distinct density, akin to a fluid substance.

The misty visage of the human figure lacked any discernible facial features, leaving everyone uncertain if it was indeed Roy. Devoid of a nose and mouth, there were only three golden-red glowing orbs atop its head, resembling eyes. While these eyes bore some resemblance to Roy's, a notable discrepancy arose from the presence of a single pair of enormous mist wings behind the humanoid form, rather than Roy's original three pairs.

Even Julia and Benia are pawing their claws. The only one who was in the center of the rift was Roy, but now the misty appearance of the humanoid makes them afraid to connect with Roy's previous appearance...

"What happened!?" Sareth asked in surprise, "Is that foster father? He doesn't look good!"

"Did he fail?" Dante's hand stretched out to his back involuntarily, holding his double guns. Virgil did the same, subconsciously grasped the hilt of Yamato, and then Dante asked "Is this thing the void creature you are talking about?"

"I don't know, it doesn't seem like it..." Julia and Benia looked blank.

"Let's look closer, but be careful!" Bayonetta suggested.

Everyone cautiously flew forward from the air again and the closer they got closer, they found that the volume of the humanoid mist was so large that it might be over forty meters tall by visual inspection. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a Titan body.

Just when everyone didn't know whether to ask questions, the Fat Tiger holding Sareth suddenly sniffed forward with all three heads, and then made three

"Oh", "Woo" and "Wang"

The cry excitedly carried Sareth and rushed forward.

Sareth immediately understood what was going on, and said excitedly "It's a foster father! It's definitely foster father! Fat Tiger smells the soul of the foster father, it can't be wrong!"

When Julia and Benia heard this, they were relieved immediately. They all knew that Fat Tiger is always accompanied by Roy’s pet, and Roy is connected to the soul. Others may admit mistakes, but Fat Tiger definitely will not.

Sure enough, when the crowd got closer again, the humanoid mist also found them. The towering body lowered its head, and the three golden-red eyes glanced at the crowd. Then the whole misty body began to twist and twist, the whole body changes visible to the naked eye slowly began to shrink.

Indeed, this humanoid mist was none other than Roy himself. After a lengthy wait, Roy finally witnessed the completion of the comprehensive transformation within his magic circuit. However, what took him by surprise was that following the alteration of his magic circuit, his body underwent a simultaneous... colossal metamorphosis.

The original solid muscles and bones turned into a fog, and even the blood was gone. His entire physical body became this kind of fog. Even the three pairs of demon wings behind it were in a foggy state. The lower merged into a pair of huge mist wings.

Roy found himself utterly bewildered in that moment, as he underwent an abrupt transition from his previous realistic appearance to a distinct Cthulhu style. Moreover, the mist that enveloped his form retained an ink painting-like quality, adding to the surreal nature of his transformation. The magnitude of this profound change, transpiring within such a brief period, caught even the devil off guard.

A creature like a demon will continue to evolve with the increase in power. This is normal, but the problem is that no one has told him that the demon can evolve into this appearance...

Is this what they refer to as the Chaos Demon? It feels different from what I had envisioned...

Roy came back to his senses and quickly open the system interface. Fortunately, even if he has undergone huge changes now, the system has always existed, so he relived.

However, after seeing the panel properties, Roy was completely confused.

[Name] Roy

[Race] Demon

[Descent] Quantum Demon...

What the hell!!??

Shouldn't it be Chaos Demon!? Why did the system label his lineage suddenly become a quantum demon!?

What is this quantum demon!? Does this kind of demon exist in the abyss world!?

Roy hadn't removed his true name liberation for a long time, because the time he takes was too long from his expectation.

Roy only temporarily woke up from the entanglement after he noticed that someone was approaching and saw that it was Julia and the others. This misty body was too big, and it was impossible to communicate normally in this state, so Roy began to try to close his body.

Fortunately, although these mists looked strange, they were indeed part of his body. Following Roy’s thoughts, his body easily accepted the control and began to condense toward the center. According to Roy’s original memory, it returned to the past about four meters.

But even though his height is back, Roy’s appearance cannot be changed. Only the original two eyes of the demon and the eye of the gods are left on his face. There is light, and when the head is twisted at will, the three streams of light also keep moving back and forth.

In the eyes of everyone, Roy's appearance is as cool as the sky now, and the whole person is full of endless mystery and weirdness, and even his breath is even more suffocating than the body of the demon king before.

Only Roy himself was very unaccustomed. He stretched out his hands and looked at the gray mist flowing from the tips of his fingers, and couldn't help but make a sound.

"Where are my nails!?"
