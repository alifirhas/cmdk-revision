# 494 - Where are my nails?

[2] When a wise life with profound wisdom is invaded by the void, it experiences intense agony and torment. This kind of pain and torture not only refers to the body, but also refers to the soul.

That kind of continuity, as if never ending pain is mixed with all kinds of weird illusions. This illusion will constantly change the scene according to the desires of the infected person's heart, and it will be happiest in you. At times, it brings you the despair that falls straight into the abyss, and when you are desperate, it suddenly makes you ecstatic. In short, it is constantly playing with the thinking of intelligent creatures and constantly hitting the will of intelligent creatures until they are completely defeated. Power can take advantage of the emptiness.

At the beginning, the chaotic dragon of the heroic and invincible world, Urgash, was so tortured and mad. During his sleep and healing, the void power infected him. Although Urgash also resisted, in the long years, he Still declared lost, when Roy and the others left, Urgash had completely turned into a void creature, not only devouring the world of Ashan, but also devouring the moon in the universe and the creation that healed in the moon. The Dragon of Asha.

Perhaps the existence of Ashan World can no longer be found in the Ten Thousand Realms. The spatial coordinates of that world are estimated to have become nothingness, leaving only a Void Lord Urgash entrenched there...

Roy’s situation now is very similar to the original Urgash. The body and soul have suffered maddening pain and torture at the same time. They may be able to resist it for a while, but if it takes a long time, Roy estimated that the twin world will also embark on the old road of Urgash.

Physical pain and torture can be sustained with willpower, but Roy can only rely on the power of the Eyes of the World to resist the pain and torture of the soul.

In the depths of Roy's soul, he is even able to turn the Eyes of the World, two endless snakes chasing each other, each time they turn, they emit a circle of light, expelling the madness and darkness from the depths of the soul. Go out some, and the two powers will cycle back and forth like this, you vie for me.

Now Roy is extremely fortunate that he has integrated the Eyes of the World and promoted to the Demon King's rank before directly contacting the void power. This has given Roy the confidence to resist the erosion of the void at the soul level. This may also be the reason that Urgash was able to persist in this way. For a long time, Roy wondered for a time if he hadn't had this Eyes of the World, would he declare a failure in resistance the first time he was exposed to the power of the void, and then fall completely?

This kind of consequence makes me shudder when I think of it...

In a short period of time, Roy can still hold on, but not for so long. Roy can only focus on the changes in the body as much as possible, hoping that he can complete the magic circuit before he completely collapses. Otherwise, it really means nothing else.

One day passed quickly, and then two days, three days, a full week, Roy was stuck in the void of the void, always fighting the erosion of the void.

In the past seven days, Roy’s location has become a forbidden zone. Julia, Benia, Sareth, Sparda, Dante, Virgil, Bayonetta, and Jeanne have been watching from a distance. They dispelled all the angels and demons still in this space, and prevented any creatures from approaching here.

In fact, there is no need for them to disperse them. As long as the guys with a bit of IQ can feel the terrifying aura from this area, even if there is curiosity in their hearts, the palpitation and desperate aura will also affect their curiosity. The heart is completely suppressed...

"It's been a week... Can Osiris succeed?" Sparda said worriedly, looking at the black spot in the center of the area.

But no one can answer his question. Only Dante put his arms around his shoulders and said "Look at it, old man, there is only so much we can do. If Osiris really fails, it is nothing more than destruction of the world. That's all, we can't escape, so we should eat and drink, get more nervous and wait for the result."

Sparda also knew that Dante was right. They really couldn’t do anything, so they could only sigh, “Oh, so I always think that the existence of this kind of out-of-specification in the world is definitely not a good thing, because once something happens or there is any action, we don’t even have the ability to stop him..."

However, before Sparda's voice could fade, an abrupt shift occurred in the central region!

The huge black ball that had covered the fissure position before had been slowly expanding towards the surroundings, but now it suddenly began to shrink back, and the density of the diffuse black electric glow suddenly began to shrink.

When everyone observed this scene, they were shocked, and immediately flew forward.

When they came to a place more than a thousand meters away from the location of the fissure, they stopped. At this moment, their vision became very clear. They were shocked to see that the eroding void force had indeed shrunk, but replaced it. An indescribable object appeared at the crack location!

It was a cloud of gray mist. This gray mist roughly looked like a human figure. On the periphery of the outline of this human figure, the endless twisted mist continued to radiate and dissipate, and The feeling of this kind of fog is not light, but very textured, as if it is a kind of fluid.

The facial features on the misty face of the human form have long since disappeared, making it impossible for everyone to tell if this is Roy. Without the nose, there is no mouth. There are only three golden-red light spots on the head, like eyes. The appearance of these three eyes can match Roy, but the problem is that only a pair of huge mist wings can be seen behind the humanoid mist, instead of Roy's original three pairs.

Even Julia and Benia are pawing their claws. The only one who was in the center of the rift was Roy, but now the misty appearance of the humanoid makes them afraid to connect with Roy's previous appearance...

"What happened!?" Sareth asked in surprise, "Is that foster father? It doesn't seem to be right!"

"Is this a success or a failure?" Dante's hand stretched out to his back involuntarily, holding his double guns.

And Virgil did the same, subconsciously grasped the hilt of Yamato, and then Dante asked "Is this thing the void creature you are talking about?"

"I don't know, it doesn't seem like it..." Julia and Benia looked blank.

"Let's look closer, but be careful!" Bayonetta suggested.

Everyone cautiously flew forward from the air again, and the closer they got closer, they found that the volume of the humanoid mist was so large that it might be over forty meters tall by visual inspection. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a Titan body. .

Just when everyone didn't know whether to ask questions, the Fat Tiger holding Sareth suddenly sniffed forward with all three heads, and then made three

"Oh", "Woo" and "Wang"

sounds. The cry, excitedly carried Sareth and rushed forward.

Sareth immediately understood what was going on, and said excitedly "It's a foster father! Definitely foster father! Fat Tiger smells the soul of the foster father, it can't be wrong!"

When Julia and Benia heard this, they were relieved immediately. They all knew that Fat Tiger is always accompanied by Roy’s pet, and Roy is connected to the soul. Others may admit mistakes, but Fat Tiger definitely will not.

Sure enough, when the crowd got closer again, the humanoid mist also found them. The towering body lowered its head, and the three golden-red eyes glanced at the crowd. Then the whole misty body began to twist and twist, the whole body The changes visible to the naked eye slowly began to shrink.

This humanoid fog is indeed Roy. It took so long and Roy finally waited for the complete change of the magic circuit to be completed, but what he didn't expect was that after the magic circuit changed, his body began to happen synchronously... a huge change.

The original solid muscles and bones turned into a fog, and even the blood was gone. His entire physical body became this kind of fog. Even the three pairs of demon wings behind it were in a foggy state. The lower merged into a pair of huge mist wings.

Roy was dumbfounded at the time, and suddenly changed from the original realistic style to this Cthulhu style, not to mention, and the fog that permeated the outline of the body still gave people a feeling of ink painting. Such a huge The transformation was completed in such a short period of time, and the demon was caught off guard.

A creature like a demon will continue to evolve with the increase in power. This is normal, but the problem is that no one has told him that the demon can evolve into this appearance...

Is this what they refer to as the Chaos Demon? It feels different from what I had envisioned...

Roy came back to his senses and quickly open the system interface. Fortunately, even if he has undergone huge changes now, the system has always existed, so he relived.

However, after seeing the beginning of the panel properties, Roy was completely confused.

[Name] Roy

[Race] Demon

[Descent] Quantum Demon...

What the hell!!??

Shouldn't it be Chaos Demon!? Why did the system label his lineage suddenly become a quantum demon!?

What is this quantum demon!? Does this kind of demon exist in the abyss world!?

Roy hadn't remove his true name liberation for a long time, because the times he takes was too long from his expectation.

Roy only temporarily woke up from the entanglement after he noticed that someone was approaching and saw that it was Julia and the others. This misty body was too big, and it was impossible to communicate normally in this state, so Roy began to try to close his body.

Fortunately, although these mists looked strange, they were indeed part of his body. Following Roy’s thoughts, his body easily accepted the control and began to condense toward the center. According to Roy’s original memory, it returned to the past about four meters.

But even though his height is back, Roy’s appearance cannot be changed. Only the original two eyes of the demon and the eye of the gods are left on his face. There is light, and when the head is twisted at will, the three streams of light also keep moving back and forth.

In the eyes of everyone, Roy's appearance is as cool as the sky now, and the whole person is full of endless mystery and weirdness, and even his breath is even more suffocating than the body of the demon king before.

Only Roy himself was very unaccustomed. He stretched out his hands and looked at the gray mist flowing from the tips of his fingers, and couldn't help but make a sound.

"Where are my nails!?"
