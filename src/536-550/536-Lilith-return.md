# 536 - Lilith's Return

**boom—** as the flash of lightning flashed through the thick black clouds, bringing a huge and dull roar of thunder, which continued to spread in the clouds, rolling away gradually.

The people startled by the thunder and straightened up from their beds in horror. They wiped the cold sweat on their foreheads, groped their way up, and lit the oil lamps. Witnessing the light of lightning that flashed from time to time. They put their hands on the oil lamps, stopping the gust of wind blow out the flickering lights, they went to the window to close the creaking window.

Looking at the thick black clouds in the sky, everyone knew that this would be a night of violent storms.

However, after closing the window, they still couldn't fall asleep. This ghost weather seemed to be foreshadowing something.

That night, many mortals had trouble sleeping, but they didn't know that such severe stormy weather was not just over their city, but almost the entire world of Sanctuary.

The strange celestial phenomenon brought a large-scale rainfall to the world of Sanctuary, and even caused the entire sea level rise a little.

Although the three worlds of High-Order Heaven, Flame Hell, and Sanctuary are not on the same spatial plane, at least there is still some correlation in them. This is why the three worlds are unified as one world. The fall of High-Order Heaven, The destruction of the Crystal Arches inevitably affected the world of Sanctuary.

The angels, led by Imperius, held an immense sense of pride. They held a special reverence for the majestic realm of the high heavens. Due to this, they strictly prohibited the mortals from the Sanctuary world from entering their sacred domain. Only those individuals deemed wise or exceptional, who had made significant contributions, would be granted the angels' benevolent gifts and be permitted to visit the high heavens.

Consequently, the mortals in the Sanctuary world could only rely on records and descriptions in books to form an impression of the high heavens. With time, the realm of the high heavens became a distant and ethereal concept, shrouded in mystery for them.

This lack of knowledge eventually led to the downfall of the high heavens. The inhabitants of the Sanctuary world remained oblivious to its fate...

Outside a small church near the Weeping Hollow on the outskirts of New Tristram, a tall figure emerged amidst the torrential rain. It was unmistakably a Crusader soldier, adorned with a broad-bladed long sword strapped to their back, a sturdy steel shield gripped firmly in their left hand, and a weighty hammer clutched in their right. The hammer's head emitted a radiant holy light, casting an illuminating glow akin to a torch, guiding their path ahead.

As the Crusader soldier approached the front and back of the church door, the radiance of the holy light unveiled the desolate scene within. The right side of the church bore the weight of collapse, with a roof in ruins and fragmented eaves and walls, bearing the scars of scorch marks and burns. The once-vibrant stained glass windows lay shattered, their vibrant colors now scattered as countless shards upon the ground.

There was not even the light of candles in the church, it was pitch black.

It was beyond imagination that this very church had once been the cherished chapel of a nearby village and town, drawing crowds just three months prior. However, in the recent strife between High Heaven and Sanctuary, anger consumed the hearts of the people. The once-beloved church fell victim to their fury, ravaged by flames, its windows shattered, and all valuable possessions plundered, leaving behind a desecrated sanctuary.

The priest within the church attempted to reason with the enraged mob, emphasizing their shared faith in the Holy Light rather than angels. Yet, amidst the chaos, the lines blurred for the furious crowd, leading them to assault the priest and drive him away, leaving the poor man wandering, his whereabouts unknown.

As the Crusader soldier stepped into the forsaken church, his recent life had been far from prosperous. His distinctive attire drew immediate recognition from the people he encountered, but their gazes held indifference and apathy. No one dared to confront him openly, yet they denied him basic provisions and shelter. Unable to find food or a place to rest, the Crusader soldier was left with no choice but to venture out under the cover of night, attempting to traverse his path in darkness.

"Why... Why has it come to this?" The Crusader soldier sighed inwardly as he pushed open the dilapidated church door. Finding refuge from the rain, he shook off the water from his body and stepped further inside. As the rain gradually subsided, he made his way deeper into the church.

In the darkness, a new glow of holy light emanated from a newly ignited hammer, revealing a figure seated amidst the rubble.

"Teacher!" The Crusader soldier who had just entered the church saluted his chest and said helplessly, "Why did you choose to meet here?"

"There's no other choice... Only here we can avoid the rain..." The man known as the mentor stood up. It could be seen that he was also a Crusader soldier, but he looked older.

The origins of the Crusaders can be traced back to the paladins of the original Zakarum religion. It is believed that many years ago, a leader among the Zakarum paladins became acutely aware of the corruption and depravity Mephisto had infused into their once pure faith. By the time he realized the extent of this corruption, it was already too late. In a desperate attempt to cleanse their beliefs, he handpicked a group of elite warriors who had managed to resist the taint of corruption. Together, they embarked on a journey to the east, officially labeled as an expedition, but in truth, they were on a covert mission to find a way to purge Mephisto's influence from their faith.

As a result, the entire Zakarum religion fell into the clutches of Mephisto and only this expedition survived. They inherited the teachings of the original Paladins and continued to believe in the Holy Light fanatically. Over time changed the name of the organization to the Crusaders. After many years, even after they returned, they still fighting on the front line against the demons.

The inheritance of the Crusader organization is the inheritance method of "mentor" and "apprentice". Every qualified Crusader soldier will accept an apprentice. They regard the apprentice as their heir and the mentor will hone the disciple into a weapon of the Holy Light. When the teacher dies, the disciple must inherit the teacher's weapon, shield, name, and the [2] jihad mission that the teacher has not yet completed.

The figure sitting among the bricks in the church was none other than the Crusader instructor, a seasoned warrior who had dedicated his life to training and guiding aspiring Crusaders. He patiently awaited the arrival of his apprentice, who would soon join him in their shared mission. As the apprentice entered the church, the instructor rose from his seat, his weathered face illuminated by the glow of the holy light emanating from his hammer. It was time for them to embark on their journey together, to continue their training and seek the means to purify their faith from the corruption that had infiltrated it.

After seeing his mentor, the Crusader apprentice said in a very helpless tone "Sorry, mentor, there is still no news from Tyrael... And the most troublesome thing is that recently, the Holy Spirit and Holy Light power in my body seems to be fading..."

"It's not just you, this is happening to me too!" His mentor replied worriedly "I already contacted other Crusader soldiers and they had the same situation. Although the power of the Holy Light did not disappear, it did attenuate. ... It seems that there is a huge change in the High Heaven!"

Hearing this, the apprentice was a little stunned and asked, "Teacher, we believe in the Holy Light, what does this have to do with High Heaven?"

"Indeed, the holy light is merely a power, independent of the angels themselves," the instructor responded, contemplating the apprentice's words. "However, it cannot be denied that the presence of the high heavens enhances the potency of the holy light within the world of Sanctuary. This connection may be linked to the Crystal Arch. Currently, our world faces no immediate threat, but the decline in the power of the holy light suggests an issue with the Crystal Arch itself." The instructor paused, his gaze filled with concern. "If we wish to restore the strength of the holy light and protect our world from darkness, we must investigate the state of the Crystal Arch and uncover the source of its weakening power."

"In addition, some time ago, the angels frequently attacked the world of Sanctuary, and suddenly they all withdrew all together..." The tutor pondered "Maybe... the reason is, the High Heaven has been invaded by demons again! "

"Then don't we want to support the High Heaven as soon as possible?" The apprentice said with wide eyes "Although it is very hateful for those arrogant angels to take action against us, but the High Heaven must be protected!"

"Why? We still don't know the situation yet" The mentor sighed "Now the entire Crusaders are scattered all over the place, looking for Tyrael's traces. It is said that he reappeared once a while ago and the Angel Legion who attacked Sanctuary at that time. There was a brief exchange, but then he seems to have gone to the High Heaven again, so far there is no news, we can't contact them at all, and the new Horadrim Church is now in chaos..."

"If all else fails, resorting to a direct approach and forcibly entering the high heavens might be our only option," the apprentice suggested, determined to find a solution. "We could seek assistance from the mage tribe. They should possess the knowledge to open a portal to the high heavens."

The Crusader Instructor scoffed disdainfully, shaking his head. "That group of mages? Humph! Don't you know? They were delighted when the High Heavens attacked Sanctuary. Those mages have always believed that the realm of mortals should be free from the influence of both heaven and hell. They harbor a deep animosity towards both angels and demons. They rejoiced when the angels were expelled, so how can we expect them to aid us in our quest to enter the high heavens?"

The apprentice fell silent, realizing the challenge they faced in seeking the mages' cooperation. It seemed that their journey to restore the power of the holy light would require finding alternative allies within Sanctuary.

"But the problem is, if there is a disruption in the High Heaven, it could potentially lead to a demonic invasion of Sanctuary!" the apprentice exclaimed, his voice filled with anxiety. "Even if the mages hold animosity towards angels, they must recognize the threat the demons pose to their own existence. We need to find a way to appeal to their self-interest and show them that helping us is the only way to safeguard their own world. Can't we leverage this to convince them?"

"Well... that is a way!" The Crusader Instructor pondered for a while, and said "Well, let's try it, but don't hold out too much hope, we still have to find a way to find Tyrael... There is also that Demon King Osiris, I suspect that this High Heaven thing has something to do with him!"

"People from Xiansai Island found the palace of the Demon King Osiris in the depths of the mountains. He seemed to be there for a while, but now he's gone..." The apprentice replied, "This is very disturbing..."

A mentor and an apprentice separated again after a brief exchange. They continued to inquire about news around the world, and other Crusader fighters were the same as them.

It can be said that the Crusader organization is the organization that pays the most attention to the High Heaven. As for other mage tribes, barbarians, and witches are not very concerned about it. After the brief conflict between the High Heaven and the Sanctuary, many Nephalems felt that it was better not to interfere in the mortal world, whether it was an angel or a demon!

The Crusaders, who traveled extensively across the world, did not receive assistance from the mage tribe. However, they ultimately received news from the priest of Rathma, who happened to be a necromancer.

The necromancers give the Crusaders the grave news that the High Heavens had fallen. Osiris, the King of Despair, led an army of demons to defeat the angelic forces and lay waste to the Crystal Arch. Within the ranks of the four archangels, the righteous Archangel Tyrael was once again imprisoned. The Archangel Auriel, the beacon of hope, was reported missing, while the Archangel of Destiny, Itherael, perished in battle. Consumed by anger, the Archangel of Courage, Imperius, succumbed to its wrath. Faced with the dire circumstances, Imperius opted for self-destruction, unwilling to be complicit in the downfall.

That is to say, after this battle, the High Heaven no longer exists, and it was already two weeks ago. The demon army has already cleaned up the battlefield and retreated to the hell of flames.

Such a news was like a bolt from the blue. It shocked everyone in the entire Crusaders organization. Although they also felt that something had happened in the High Heaven, they did not expect it to be so serious. They didn't expect the war is already over.

In the aftermath of the shock, the Crusaders swiftly disseminated the news to other organizations, causing ripples throughout the entire Sanctuary world. Even the mages, setting aside their prejudices temporarily, endeavored to collaborate and establish a path towards higher realms. They sought to open a portal to access the High Heaven and witness the state there firsthand.

Consequently, what greeted their eyes was nothing but the aftermath of devastation of High Heaven that was once magnificent and glorious, now shrouded in darkness, devoid of the radiant light of the Holy Light. The land lay barren and desolate, presenting a scene of utter desolation.

This time, everyone was overwhelmed. After realizing it, they look back and find that although angels are also hateful, they are the first target of the devil's attack. Before the High Heaven fell, they has resisted most of the demon invasions, and the impact on Sanctuary is only one-sided.

Now that the High Heaven is gone and the shields are gone, doesn't it mean that the Sanctuary will be the only place to resist the devil in the future?

Just when the leaders of various organizations held a meeting and debated what to do next, no one thought that the first to act was the necromancers of the Rathma sect.

The reason why the news of the destruction of the High Heaven was first reported is because the head of the Rathma sect, Trag'Oul, participated in the battle of the High Heaven, although he failed to stop Roy and was unable to save the High Heaven. The fate of falling, but after returning, he immediately thought about what to do next.

For Trag'Oul, his action has already provoked the Demon King Osiris. He is very worried that the demon will target to his star-soul titan, so he must have a strength in order to fight against the demon.

So he thought of the Nephalems in Sanctuary. These Nephalems have powerful powers that are not inferior to angels and demons. Especially after the destruction of the World Stone, this power is still further strengthened. If They can unite against the flames of hell, maybe they can take on the responsibilities of the original High Heaven.

But the premise is that they can really be united... Trag'Oul has always observed the world of mortals. He has witnessed the war between mortals for thousands of years. He still understands human nature quite well and whether they can unite. Trag'Oul had always had this big questions.

Trag'Oul felt that these nephalems might need a leader, a leader who could bring them together.

In the end, while Trag'Oul informed the Rathma Sect of the fall of the High Heavens through revelation, he found a very special necromancer in the Rathma Sect.

This person is the founder of the Rathma Sect, Mendeln!

Yes, Mendeln is still alive. As Uldyssian's brother, Mendeln has lived until now after the original sin. He is the first generation of Nephalem, the true son of Inarius and Lilith, with far more The lifespans of other Nephalems. In the battle of Original Sin, Uldyssian sacrificed himself and expelled all the angels and demons at that time, and Mendeln witnessed all this with his own eyes, his memory was not sealed after the war.

In other words, he's the only Nephalem who still remembers the original sin...

After the war, Mendeln accepted Trag'Oul's teachings, founded the Rathma Sect, and became the first necromancer in the world of Sanctuary. He has been in seclusion and developed the Rathma Order. Looking for Mendeln, Trag'Oul think his identity as the first generation of Nephalem is an identity that can unite the human beings in Sanctuary. I hope he can stand up as a leader.

However, Trag'Oul didn't know that after learning that the High Heaven had fallen, Mendeln's own thoughts were different from Trag'Oul.

Although he believes in Trag'Oul's teachings, he does not believe in Trag'Oul himself. During the years of contact with Trag'Oul, Mendeln is very clear that Trag'Oul is only protecting himself. Now that the High Heaven is gone, he is eager to push mortals out for him to resist the prying eyes of demons!

More than that, in addition to the original Seven Demon Kings, Osiris, the King of Despair, is now in the Hell of Flames. Mendeln also realizes the power of hel today. He believes that relying on the strength of the mortals in the Sanctuary, he's afraid unable to stop the attack of Hell of Flames.

So, Mendeln walked out of the jungle of Kehjistan and walked on the ground of Sanctuary again. Relaying on his past memory, he found the seal and altar that Inarius had set when he expelled Lilith.

This is a dark hall with a huge magic circle engraved on the ground. Three stone pillars stand in an equilateral triangle in the magic circle. The obscure angelic language and demonic language are alternately engraved on the stone pillars.

Then, he spread rumors, claiming that there was a lot of gold and silver treasures buried here, in order to attract the robbers and gangsters in the sanctuary to come to seek treasure, he killed these robbers and gangsters, and poured their blood into them continuously in the altar.

In the world of Sanctuary, every mortal possesses the blood of the Nephalem. However, due to the passage of time and the countless generations that have passed, this bloodline has gradually diluted. Nonetheless, even in its diluted form, it remains Nephalem in essence. When these traces of pure Nephalem blood converge, they create a focal point, a coordinate within the material realm.

To establish contact with this coordinate, one must seek the progenitor of all Nephalem, the revered Queen of the Crimson Seas—Lilith, whose essence embodies the very essence of the Nephalem bloodline.

Mendeln's plan went very smoothly. After collecting the last wave of blood sacrifices, Mendeln guided the sacrifices and said the prayer himself

[3]
> By three they come. By three, thy way opens. <br>
> By the blood of the willing, we call thee home <br>
> Hail, Daughter of Hatred <br>
> Creator of Sanctuary <br>
> Hail...Lilith <br>

As the prayers resonated through the air, the final three sacrifices, suspended upside down and bound to the stone pillars, had their chests brutally ripped open. The blood gushed forth, converging with the sacrificial blood of all others, forming a vast triangular plane that stretched before them.

A phantom materialized abruptly above a plane composed of blood. It descended slowly, passing through the layer of blood until, at the moment of passing, the phantom transformed into a tangible entity, gradually solidifying. Finally, Lilith's form descended from the void to the ground, entering the material world.

Mendeln extended his hand, clasping Lilith's outstretched palm, and lifted his gaze. He beheld Lilith's countenance, which had recently transitioned from ethereal to corporeal, still possessing a hint of translucency but exuding a crimson hue. He uttered in a hushed tone,

"Our Lady of Grace... Bestow your salvation upon us!"
