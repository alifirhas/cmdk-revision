# 537 - The most elusive demon queen

In the face of Mendeln's earnest call, Lilith didn't speak, she just lowered her head slightly and looked at her former son in front of her.

The transformation between void and matter is still going on in her body. Lilith's naked body has a strange reflection on her skin, but the most interesting thing is her cold [2] child holes. I don't know what happened, but the color of Lilith's child hole alternated between black and gold, giving people a very unstable feeling.

"The Mighty Queen The Female Demon King"

Mendeln noticed this, but had no idea what was going on.

Fortunately, this predicament proved to be temporary. As Lilith's body eventually settled and cooled, the color of her child's hole became fixed. It transformed into a dual-tone combination of black and gold, exhibiting contrasting hues. Additionally, black tears materialized under her eye sockets, while dark lips adorned her pale skin, imparting an enchanting allure. The bony demon's horns, with pronounced veins, took the shape of a devil's crown. The two thickest pairs protruded upwards, held high on either side, while the smaller pair curved downwards like sideburns around her neck.

Lilith made a slight move and a pair of huge demon wings stretched out from her back.

This pair of huge demon wings looked very ferocious, the wing membrane between the wing bones are grayish-white. At the end of the wings, several extremely sharp bone spurs hung down to the ground, very much like a blades.

Behind Lilith, a slender tail extends downwards, its length considerable. Devoid of flesh and blood, the tail consists of a chain-like formation crafted from bones. At the tail's end, the tips splay out resembling sharp claws.

The layer of flesh and blood barrier that Lilith passed through when she descended originally formed a huge flesh and blood cloak behind her, but this flesh and blood cloak also turned into blood-red petals, lingering around her body. These blood-red petals In the end, it turned into a baroque-style shirt and wore it on Lilith's body. After wearing this black, dress-like shirt, Lilith looked even more bewitching.

The form of the Demon King, pale skin, strangely colored child holes, and eyes that are so cold that one can freeze. Facing the gaze of the Demon Queen, Mendeln also felt a lot of pressure, he knelt down on one knee and lowered his head, Whispered "My Lady, I welcome your return..."

However, before the words fell, a huge force struck, directly smashing Mendeln out and hitting the opposite stone pillar. With a bang, the stone pillar collapsed, Mendeln rolled in the gravel, and bounced on the ground. After he fell several times, he finally stopped far away from where he stood.

Mendeln struggling to get up, spitting out blood in the process. But he didn't dare to do anything, he still walked over to Lilith and knelt in front of her.

He knew very well that after being exiled to the void for so many years, Lilith had accumulated countless anger in her heart that needed to be vented. It was completely normal to have such a reaction.

However, perhaps it was the blood flowing from the corner of Mendeln's mouth that made Lilith smell her own blood, so she did not attack Mendeln again, but spoke slowly, using a lazy and provocative voice to address Mendeln. Said "Look up..."

Mendeln raised his head according to the words and then saw Lilith stretch out her pale fingers, wipe the blood on the corner of Mendeln's mouth, and put the blood-stained fingers on his dark lips, Taste the taste of Mendeln's blood.

"What...?"

A groan emanated from Lilith's throat, accompanied by her captivating voice, causing Mendeln's blood to surge uncontrollably. In an attempt to regain his composure, he hastily bit the tip of his tongue to snap himself out of the trance.

Even though Lilith's actions were unintentional, being the world's first succubus, her every unconscious movement possessed an unparalleled allure for male beings. Mendeln was acutely aware of this fact, yet he dared not entertain any illusions or desires whatsoever.

Not because he respects Lilith, on the contrary, he is afraid! As a friend and brother who traveled with Uldyssian, Mendeln still remembers the time when Lilith first returned. You must know that although Lilith is the mother of Nephalem, she has no concept of ethics. She even seduced Uldyssian to have descendant with her when she was a succubus.

This is what Mendeln is afraid of. Once he has any delusions about Lilith, he will be noticed by Lilith, and then it will be bad...

"I remember the smell of this blood..." Fortunately, Lilith spoke up at this time and said, "You are... Mendeln, my child, right?"

"Yes, My Lady!" Mendeln replied, head bowed.

"Mendeln..." Lilith's index finger slid across his face and the sharp black nails smeared a bloodstain on Mendeln's face, although the bloodstain disappeared quickly, doing so made Lilith's eyes deep With a flash of happiness. She asked with cold words and a charming voice "My child, speak to me. When you witnessed Inarius banish me to the void, you did not come to my aid. And now, after banishing me from the void, you have summoned me back to rescue you. Should I not feel angered by your actions?"

Lilith's resentment is very heavy. In fact, just imagine it. In order to protect the Nephalem in Sanctuary, Lilith even turned against heaven and hell at the same time. She killed all the angels in Sanctuary. and demons, just to protect their children.

But these protected children turned into white-eyed wolves as soon as they turned their heads. Their bloodline gave them an incomparably powerful power, in return they used their power to betray the hand that give them food. This led to Lilith being successfully exiled by Inarius.

This exile spans thousands of years, enduring the desolate realm of the void. Merely a year in such solitude is enough to drive one to madness, let alone thousands of years. Lilith wonders how she managed to endure the relentless passage of time.

Now, these unworthy descendants not only have no thought of atonement, but want to ask themselves for help, Lilith doesn't know how they can say this...

Undoubtedly, Mendeln was well aware of the cause and effect of the Nephalem's transgressions. However, he had no intention of severing ties with Lilith. When Lilith initially emerged from the void, fueled by her animosity towards Inarius, she sought Uldyssian's support. However, Uldyssian, reluctant to be a pawn in Lilith's schemes, opted to resist. With each side perceiving the situation from different perspectives, both held their own truths, making it difficult to discern a clear path forward.

So Mendeln said "My Lady, this time I guide you to return from the void because of a huge thing happen in Sanctuary, the High Heaven... is gone!"

"Oh?" said Lilith, Mendeln's method of changing the subject was still effective. After hearing this, Lilith really became interested and asked, "What happened?"

So Mendeln told Lilith what Trag'Oul had told him.

However, what Mendeln didn't expect was that when the name of Osiris, the king of despair, was mentioned, Lilith suddenly let out a shrill scream, and she suddenly hugged her head, looking in pain.

At the same time, her [3] Enigmatic Orifice has also changed. The original strange-colored Enigmatic Orifice has now become two golden ones, a terrifying and trembling force that Lily has never seen before. Silk burst out, it was a black mist that was too deep to look directly at, the mist enveloped Lilith's body, making her whole body tremble.

When this power erupted, Mendeln backed away in horror, looked at Lilith in disbelief, while listened to her shrill roar echoing in the secret room.

After a while, Lilith finally stopped shaking and became quiet. An invisible force enveloped her body, forcing the deep dark fog back again.

Mendeln asked cautiously, "My Lady, what just happened?"

"It's nothing, I just... Received a memory!" Lilith regained her strange-colored child hole and an unexpected look flashed across her face.

She didn't lie, she did receive a memory just now, and this memory came from another clone of hers in another world!

Although Lilith is not Mephisto's real daughter, Lilith does have some abilities that are very similar to Mephisto's, such as the ability to obtain memories from other avatars. Not every Demon King has such abilities.

"Osiris?" Lilith repeating the name, after receiving this memory, she finally remembered something, and muttered to herself "So that's the case, the figure that was free to move in the void before is Osiris? Sure enough, a strange demon... So, he brought the eggs of the Red Sea?"

When Mendeln heard Lilith's words, he was a little puzzled and asked, "My Lady, have you... have you met Osiris, the King of Despair? Also, what was that terrifying power you mentioned...?"

"It's nothing, let's move on!" Of course Lilith wouldn't explain to Mendeln. In fact, the terrifying power that erupted on her body just now was Void Erosion! Lilith was exiled in the void for so long, how could she not be corrupted by the void, but the corruption of the void was restrained by Lilith's special power, if it wasn't for the fact that she appeared when she received the memory just now After a brief absence, otherwise the void power in her body would not easily riot.

Mendeln didn't dare to ask any more questions, he continued to tell what had happened recently, and finally said "My Lady, the High Heaven has fallen, three archangel has died, the rest is missing or disappeared. The Hell of Flames has won this war. Next, the demons may invade Sanctuary on a large scale. Their power is unprecedentedly powerful. Human power alone cannot stop the army of hell. We need your guidance! "Surely, you wouldn't want witness to the harrowing sight of your own children merciless kll by demons, would you?"

"Humph!" Lilith snorted coldly, and walked towards the exit without saying anything. Mendeln hesitated for a while, and followed behind Lilith and walked out of the secret room together.

As Lilith descended to the ground, she delicately unfurled her demonic wings, causing the altar room behind her to tremble violently. The powerful earthquake shook the very foundation of the coordinates where Lilith had been exiled. In a resounding display of her power, Lilith personally brought about the demise of the loathsome structure that had repulsed her, reducing it to rubble and ruin.
