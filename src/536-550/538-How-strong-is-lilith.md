# 538 - How Strong is Lilith?

In the world of Diablo, Sanctuary, High Heaven and Flame Hell are physically separated from each other. High Heaven and Flame Hell belong to different purgatory spaces, while Sanctuary is sandwiched between Hidden in the gap between the two.

However, due to the existence of the portal, these three places are related to each other in terms of space concept. That is to say, in theory, mortals in the Sanctuary can go to the High Heaven and the flame hell.

However, in the thousands of years of history of Sanctuary, the rumors about the High Heaven and the Flame Hell handed down are quite rare, and the description of these rumors is only a general concept.

If  the High Heaven bars mortals from entering due to the angels' arrogance and disdain for the mortal realm, then the Flame Hell rejects feeble mortals due to its cruel and harrowing environment.

Unlike the High Heaven that closed most of the portals, the Hell of Flames is actually open to the Sanctuary. The demons dream of invading the world of Sanctuary. Naturally, it will not restrict the exchanges between the Hell of Flames and the Sanctuary.

[2] On the former site of Zakarum Cathedral in Kurast, there used to be the largest hell portal so far, which is in the deepest part of the ground of Zakarum Cathedral. Of course, this gate of hell has been destroyed, Along with the cathedral, and has been reduced to ruins.

The gate to Hell was a portal that opened when Mephisto, Diablo, and the Baal brothers were "rebelled" by the four demon lords, including Andariel. Subsequently, they were banished to Sanctuary but eventually found their way back to the Hellish realm known as the Hell of Flames. The three brothers were expelled.

All of this unfolded due to a conspiracy planned by the seven demon kings. It all began with the tumultuous Original Sin War, which led to the unfortunate exile of Lilith, one of the creators of Sanctuary, back into the desolate void. In the midst of this chaos, the other creator, Inarius, became a pawn in the power struggle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. In a rather ironic twist, the angels, using Inarius as a bargaining chip, handed him over to the forces of Hell, under the condition that the Hell of Flames conform to the principles of the High Heaven. As a consequence, this meant that the denizens of Flame Hell were forever barred from setting foot in the world of Sanctuary.

Clearly, this arrangement was an agreement, a contract of sorts. The angels, recognizing the immense power of the Nephalem, were wary of the possibility of these extraordinary beings falling into the clutches of the devil. Thus, they devised a way to forge this contract, ensuring that the Nephalem would be shielded from manipulation by the forces of evil.

However, they forgot that demons are the best at exploiting contract loopholes. They were expelled under the pretext of "rebellion". The three Mephisto brothers breach the contract with the High Heaven and were able to enter the Sanctuary again. When they corrupted the Zakarum Cult and achieved their goal, there was this huge hell portal in the cathedral.

The gate of hell opened by the efforts of the three demon gods is quite magnificent and huge. It was originally used to let the Hell Flame invade the Sanctuary, but the Demons were not very lucky, and this plan was eventually rejected. The high heavens discovered that the Nephalems, with the help of Tyrael, worked together to destroy the gate of hell.

If this gate of hell is still there, you can enter the space where the Flame Hell is located by crossing this portal.

As soon as you come out of the gate of hell, the first thing you see is the fortress of demons. This is the outermost periphery of the Flame Hell. There are all kinds of demons who are not in the mainstream and those who died in the eternal battle cannot return. The Demon Fortress can be said to be the main place where the Hell of Flames will meet the enemy in the eternal battle. The angel army of the High Heaven has also hit here countless times. In order to prevent the angels from continuing to attack the depths of the Hell of Flame, the demons They have established a large number of defenses here, and all kinds of ferocious and sturdy fortresses with open teeth and claws stand together on the top of the mountain, forming a powerful fortress, which is the origin of the name of the fortress.

After crossing the fortress of demons, there is the Plain of Despair. The Plain of Despair belongs to the painful realm of the Flame Hell. It is the area under the control of Andariel, the Queen of Pain. It is filled with poisonous ashes all day long, and even breathing will make people feel pain, and these pains Will make Andariel feel very happy.

If the Queen of Pain Andariel enjoys mental pain, then her brother Duriel enjoys physical pain, which is why Duriel is called the King of Torment, his territory The Tormented Land is next to Andariel's territory.

Passing through the Plain of Despair and going deeper, it is the City of Punishment. The City of Punishment is almost close to the center of the Hell of Flames. It used to belong to the edge of the Lord of Destruction's territory. Baal likes to destroy, and it always builds a lot. Mighty buildings resembling mortal churches, and then destRoyg them all, is just the most trivial of the many destruction games of Lord of Destruction.

The City of Punishment is a macabre sight, with bones strewn about in every direction, and the anguished souls of the damned writhing in eternal torment within their chains. The oppressive ground bears deep cracks, revealing glimpses of the fiery river that courses through the layers of the Hell of Flames. Undoubtedly, the River of Fire stands as the epitome of this infernal realm, its prominence unrivaled by any other.

This is a vast sea of ​​magma, which is mixed with winding rock paths. The river of flames seems to be the source of energy for the Flame Hell. This is also the core area of ​​the realm of destruction controlled by Baal. Demons have built many forgings here. Forge, use fire and lava to create demon weapons with dark powers to arm the demon army.

The source of the River of Fire comes from the depths of the Chaos Demon Temple, the central area of ​​the Realm of Fear governed by Diablo, which is next to the Realm of Destruction.

Chaos Demon Temple is Diablo's hidden residence. Deep underground is the source of the River of Fire. This is a huge cross-shaped building, similar to a broken cathedral, but the cathedral is surrounded by flames and lava. As time passed, lava and blood scorched the exterior of the Chaos Demon Temple.

Inside the Chaos Devil Palace, piles of skulls are hidden at the bottom of the walls, and countless skulls are scattered on the floor and piled up in the cracks of the walls, surrounded by hot magma, lava and huge torches standing on the ground, giving chaos The Devil's Temple brought a terrifying glimmer of light, illuminating the souls who were locked on the pillars and could not rest in peace.

Flame Hell is not a whole piece like High Heaven, but is divided into seven realms. The seven realms of hell are isolated from each other by the void. Each realm is an independent space bubble, which can be reached by portals. Each realm is controlled by a demon king and its environment is also different, but in general everyplace are extremely cruel. The environment here bears a striking resemblance to the abyssal realm, leaving me uncertain whether it existed in this manner from the inception of Flame Hell or if it underwent a gradual transformation by the hands of the Seven Demon Kings.

The reason why there are so many descriptions is because there is a fact that the Hell of Flames is now full and each of the seven demon kings has an area under their control.

This is a very funny thing. Mephisto brought in Roy as a foreign aid from the abyss world, but he never seemed to think about how the site would be divided if Roy wanted to enter the Hell of Flames.

This is actually not to blame for Mephisto, even he did not expect that after Roy intervened in this world, the High Heaven would collapse so quickly.

It could be attributed to the prolonged conflict between the Seven Demon Kings and the High Heaven within this realm. Over time, both sides have become accustomed to their established ways of thinking and battle tactics, resulting in a stalemate. The victor seemed all but determined, until the unexpected arrival of Roy, an outsider. Caught off guard, the High Heaven lacked any understanding of his true power, rendering them vulnerable and easily overwhelmed in the face of Roy's presence. It was as if a simple touch of a button could cause their entire defense to crumble.

The High Heaven has been destroyed and the problem immediately arises, because the Seven Demon Kings regard the Sanctuary as a forbidden place. After all, the Sanctuary has countless souls for them to seize, and there are powerful Nephalem powers that can be used by them. High Heaven Already down, Sanctuary is the most delicious fruit of victory they can get. They can't let Roy get involved, so they can't let Roy continue to stay in Sanctuary, cause they are afraid that Roy will sneak away first.

After escaping from the dark soul stone, the Seven Demon Kings are still recovering. They need to recover the wounds in their souls and re-condense their powerful bodies. Under such circumstances, their strength has declined. From Roy's attack on High Heaven Judging from the strength they showed at the time, they didn't have much chance of winning against Roy alone. On the contrary, in the Flame Hell, the seven demon kings could join forces to fight against Roy.

So, after the end of the High Heaven war, Mephisto couldn't wait to invite Roy to the Hell of Flames as a guest.

The Seven Demon Kings have joined forces to fight against the High Heaven in this world for many years. Although they are a little bit naughty with each other, the overall friendship is still there, but when facing Roy, an outsider, the filth between them is all. let go.

Just like the Angiris Council organized by the angels, the Seven Demon Kings also formed a loose council called the Hellfire Council. This name is not as famous as the Angiris Council, even many demons in the Hell of Flame may not have heard of it. However, this council put it bluntly, that is, the Seven Demon Kings get together to discuss things, and there are no rules and regulations and programs of action.

The place where the Hellfire Council was held was in Diablo's Chaos Demon Temple. In a room full of powerful dark forces in the deepest part of the Demon Temple, there were seven huge dark thrones. Arranged in order, the Seven Demon Kings each have a throne here.

In the pervading dark fog, the strange bodies of the Seven Demon Kings are looming, and their shining eyes are the only light source in the darkness, making this picture so eerie.

As for Roy, he was sitting next to the three dark thrones above.

Several days have passed since the convening of the Hellfire Council. Right from the start, Andariel and the other four demon kings expressed their discontent with Roy's position. However, one by one, they were beaten by Roy's, eventually accepting his authority. As for the treatment of the High Heaven prisoners of war, the seven demon kings are well aware that Tyrael's soul now rests in Roy's hands. The Archangel Tyrael, known for his commitment to justice, is despised by the demon kings even more than Imperius.

Moreover, we need only consider the fate of Inarius, who fell into the clutches of Mephisto and his cohorts. His eyes were gouged out, and his wings and limbs tortured relentlessly. One can only imagine the unspeakable horrors that would befall Tyrael if he were to fall into their merciless grasp.

However, for the request of the Seven Demon Kings, Roy was just two letter: "o"

For Tyrael, Roy has his own use, so no matter how the Seven Demon Kings hint, conditions, or even coercion, Roy has only one attitude... No.

The Seven Demon Kings and Roy talked for a few days, even though they speak until their saliva was dry, Roy could not be shaken at all. In the end, they had to give up temporarily and turned to Roy to ask for another trophy.

This trophy, found in the ruins of the crystal arch, this is a key that condenses the power of the powerful Holy Light! After the Seven Demon Kings studied this thing, it turned out to be the real core of God Anu's Crest Crystal. After the original huge crystal of God Anu's Crest collapsed, it seemed that the remaining Holy Light power finally condensed into this key.

Even Mephisto can't guess what this key of light is. The only one who might know about it is Imperius, but Imperius has self-destructed and died, so what exactly is this thing? It's hard to tell what it's useful for.

[3] However, combined with the origin of the High Heaven, after discussing the Seven Demon Kings, they felt that this thing might be the key to Eden!

[3] Eden, that is, Eden Garden! It is the original place of heaven, the true birthplace of all angels and holy lights, and the ultimate and highest level of heaven. Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, these famous original archangels are stationed in Eden.

Since heaven is at war with demons in thousands of worlds, various levels of heaven have also been derived. These heavens are the secondary military bases of angels, supporting the eternal war between angel legions and demons.

This was confirmed by interrogating Tyrael's soul. The higher-order heaven belongs to the next-level heaven below Eden and even the higher-order heaven is still related to Eden. Tyrael once projected from Eden. In the the projection book of truth, Tyrael found Roy's name, which is the proof.

However, just as the Seven Demon Kings thought, the only person responsible for contacting Eden is Imperius. The place of contact is also in the crystal arch and it is estimated that it is with the Crest of God Anu. Crystal is related, but it is not clear whether this Holy Light key is the key to open the gate of Eden Heaven. It should also be the Star Soul Titan, and it should be a Star Soul Titan with both light and dark powers. Otherwise, it will not correspond to the creation myth of this world.

In Roy's guess, this world should have given birth to a star-soul titan first, but this star-soul titan wanted to separate the two types of himself because of his death and ended up losing himself. Two purgatory spaces of High Heaven and flaming hell have been formed. Angels and demons just discovered this world and settled in. Then because the history of the eternal battle is too long, the angels and demons here are faintly independent. Therefore, they rarely mentioned the origins of the two parties themselves, and finally acquiesced to the myth of God Anu's creation.

Roy felt that if his guess was correct, then this world might be the "sowing ground" of the Star Soul Titan. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain that after God Anu, the Star Soul Titan, the Sanctuary actually gave birth to a tower. Trag'Oul, such a new star soul titan.

In short, no matter what the Holy Light key is, this is one of Roy's chips now. For this key, he did not hold on to it like he did with Tyrael's soul, but promised to take it out. Give it to the Seven Demon Kings, but you have to exchange it accordingly.

After all, if this key can really open the door of Eden, Roy does not have the courage to attack Eden Paradise. In addition, if the key is to open the door to the birthplace of Star Soul Titan, it is also very dangerous. Let them go if they die, Roy didn't want to get involved.

Since this key is potentially very risky, Roy does not intend to hold it, not to mention that this thing has to be used together with the cornerstone of the Flame Hell: the furnace of hell, so Roy did not ask too much. After exchanging a considerable number of souls from the Seven Demon Kings, he also gave away the keys.

After all these are done, the main event finally comes, which is about the distribution of the cake of Sanctuary.

In fact, according to the level of Demon King, ordinary souls and the like, Mephisto and the others have long despised them. The population of Sanctuary is not very high, and the number of souls that can be obtained is naturally very limited. The Seven Demon Kings shouldn't be so concerned about Sanctuary.

But this is actually wrong. The quality of the human souls in the Sanctuary world can be said to be beyond imagination. In addition to the influence of the Nephalem bloodline, this world has suffered too many hardships! Just as Tyrael can see the tenacity and kindness of the mortals born here under the ordeal, the devil can also see the distortion and darkness in the hearts of the mortals here under the ordeal!

War is actually the most test of human nature. The world of Sanctuary has been repeatedly baptized by both High Heaven and flame hell. The human soul here can be said to have super-high quality that humans in other worlds cannot have.

Either Uldyssian is like a saint, or he is crazy and twisted like Skeleton King Leoric... In short, the mortal souls of this Sanctuary world are very attractive to the Seven Demon Kings.

In the early years, if the Seven Demons invaded Sanctuary only because of the World Stone, then after the World Stone was destroyed, the Seven Demons' coveted Sanctuary had also been transferred to Nephalem.

In particular, Mephisto and the others had all participated in the original sin war. They had seen the powerful power that erupted from Uldyssian, and they were very clear about the power of Nephalem. Out of control, when the restriction of the World Stone on the Nephalems no longer exists, then the Nephalems are on the verge of losing control while their power is growing, and the Nephalems who will lose their humanity after losing control, will It will completely fall into the darkness, and it will become the best thug and tool used by the Demons!

Imagine if Roy went to attack a certain world, with hundreds of thousands of Dante and Virgil behind him, or hundreds of thousands of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, what would it be like?

Not to mention the Seven Demons, even Roy wanted this world a little after he figured it out...

So when he saw the extremely greedy expression on the faces of the Seven Demon Kings, Roy understood that it was impossible to convince the Seven Demon Kings to withdraw to the abyss world and keep the Sanctuary for himself.

What Roy said to Tyrael before has really become a reality, and he is afraid that he will really have a fight with the Seven Demon Kings.

It's not uncommon for demons to turn allies into enemies, so Roy didn't participate in the dispute over the division of the cake between the Seven Demon Kings, but quietly watched their mutual filial piety.

Of course he won't reveal his thoughts on Sanctuary here, but maybe his silence is a bit abnormal, so Mephisto noticed it, and Mephisto roared a few times, suppressing the rest of the demon kings After the sound of his voice, he turned to Roy and said, "Osiris, don't you have any idea about Sanctuary? Don't worry, say your request, we will try our best to satisfy you!"

Roy glanced at Mephisto, then looked at Diablo, Baal, Andariel, Duriel, Azmodan and Belial who were sitting a little below, and sneered "I don't want to. I speak because I don't think it makes any sense to discuss this now, Mephisto, don't forget, you saw Lilith's return in the future clip, as the mother of the Nephalem, you want to If the Sanctuary is included in the bag, you must pass the Lilith level. Before you defeat Lilith, what you discussed is all empty talk!"

"That's right!" Mephisto nodded and said, "And this is the reason why I invite you from the abyss, Osiris, I am here to promise you on behalf of the Hellfire Council, as long as you work with us to defeat Lilith, then you will be the one who gets the biggest cake in the allocation of Sanctuary!"

"Let's talk about this separately!" Roy waved his hand, looked at Mephisto with a serious face, and asked, "Tell me honestly, how strong is Lilith...? Will it be worth your jealousy?"

"..." Mephisto and Diablo looked at each other blankly, and after a moment of hesitation, they said, "To be honest, I don't know very well, Lilith's fighting power in the past was only a mere An ordinary demon king, even Andariel is inferior, but that has been a matter of thousands of years, and now that she has been exiled to the void for many years, we don't know what her true strength is..."

"Then why did you bring me here so solemnly?" Roy asked suspiciously, frowning.

"Because, in the future clip, I saw... Lilith holding Diablo's skull!" Mephisto said gloomily "Not only that, I even saw her killing all us. I, Diablo, Baal, and Andariel all will died at the hands of Lilith..."

## Change Notes

[1] Name Changes

- Geor -> Trag'Oul

[2] Note on this, there is a typo in the word "Trivank," which is quite similar to "Tristram." However, the Zakarum Cathedral is not based in Tristram. According to the Diablo wiki, the Zakarum Cathedral is initially based in Kurast. Later, in Diablo III, its location is associated with Westmarch. Therefore, I will replace "Trivank" with "Kurast" to accurately depict the earlier setting of the Zakarum Cathedral.

[3] After some searching, I couldn't find any mention of a Yinsidian Garden in the Diablo Wiki. However, I did come across references in Greek Mythology, particularly the Elysian Fields, which shares similarities with Yinsidian Fields. But hold on, it's said that "Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, these famous original archangels are stationed" and it's highly unlikely they have any connection to Greek Mythology. So, for the time being, let's just go with the Garden of Eden. I'm gonna update it later if more context becomes available.
