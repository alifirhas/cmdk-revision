It looks like I can’t wait to return...","\"What are these lines?\" Roy thought strangely, \"Could it be that these are the so-called lines of fate?\"","\"What's wrong?\" Julia and Benia didn't know what was going on. They just watched Roy inexplicably raise his hand to destroy the wreckage of the floating island, but now they frowned, so Asked curiously.","After about ten minutes, Roy seemed to have caught something, and the dancing fingers suddenly squeezed together. In the next moment, Roy saw the remains of the floating island with an area of ​​thousands of square meters in the distance suddenly cracked and turned into countless dust.","After hearing Roy's mumbling, Julia and Benia immediately revealed surprises in their eyes. Of course, they also knew that Roy was fused with Godhead, but they didn't expect Roy to master it so quickly. The power of authority.","After seeing the four horsemen of the Apocalypse leave, Roy turned his head and looked at Sparda, Dante, Virgil, and Nero. The grandfather and grandson. At this moment, all of them are still in the form of demons, looking at Rpy with the same vigilance.","All of this stems from the different eye structures between creatures.","As Julia and Benia stared in surprise, Roy's forehead was centered on the center of his eyebrows, and a gap opened. The tough demon skin seemed to have been cut with a knife and it slowly spread to both sides, revealing A newly emerged demon's eye inside.","Because this newly-emerged vertical pupil is exactly the product of the fusion of the Mobius Mark godhead and Roy.","Eyes are the only way most creatures use to observe the world. However, in the eyes of different creatures, perhaps they observe the world differently.","Eyes of the World is a good thing, but this kind of good thing falls into the hands of a demon, that’s another matter. Even if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were summoned by Roy, this doesn’t mean they would like to see Roy. A new Demon King is born.","Fortunately, Roy did not think about what to do with these two worlds...","Frogs are highly sensitive to moving objects in nature, but their vision is less clear when they are stationary. Most insects possess compound eyes, making it difficult to comprehend their visual perception. Snakes have limited vision but rely on thermal detection to locate prey. Human eyes can perceive a visual image of 576 million pixels and discern approximately 1 million colors, although color blindness and color weakness are common. The mantis shrimp, on the other hand, exhibits exceptional color discrimination ability, being capable of distinguishing up to 16 colors, including ultraviolet and infrared rays invisible to humans. Additionally, they can detect linearly and circularly polarized light. However, as the mantis shrimp lacks intelligence, it remains elusive to describe the world they perceive through their eyes...","However, after destroying the wreckage, Roy frowned, and thought \"It's not right, it shouldn't be like this\". He clearly saw that the floating island wreckage itself spread after being destroyed. The string that came out has not disappeared, but changed to another form and continues to blend into the strings of this world.","However, this time, Roy did not use magic, but tentatively reached out his hand. The five sharp fingers faced the wreckage and began to dance gently.","In addition to the world and colors observed in the past, there are many more things Roy can't describe in the macro scene. It may be a special ray that was difficult to perceive in the past. Roy can't tell for a while. Something, but the most special thing is that Roy saw... strings!","In order to verify whether his guess was correct, Roy looked around and found that there was a broken floating island in the far horizon. It was a small piece of debris from the floating island of Heaven that was crushed in the previous war. There are still countless wires connected, so Roy raised his hand to release a huge group of destruction flames, completely destroying it.","In some literary works, there are often such sentences and adjectives \"The goddess of fate has plucked the strings of fate\". Roy didn't think there was anything in this sentence before, but now he saw these illusory threads with his own eyes. Roy suddenly discovered that perhaps this sentence may be true.","In the sky, four vigorous steeds came in the air, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse came slowly towards Roy on their respective mounts. Farther away, Bayonetta and Jeanne also stepped on their feet. The magical aperture is constantly jumping, rushing towards this side.","In this feeling, it is really great! Roy can clearly feel that it is a supreme power!","It was amazing. This kind of seeing the whole process of magic forming with his own eyes was simply too amazing for Roy. He had never thought that the magic he had released in the past was actually made in this way.","Julia and Benia dared not come out and watched Roy's movements silently. Even Sareth and Dante Nero and the others came back and raised their fingers and hissed at them, beckoning them to be quiet. Don't disturb Roy.","No one knows what he did just now, only Roy himself knows. In fact, he has been trying to figure out a way to move the \"strings\" spreading out on the floating island. After trying for a long time, he finally found out. The root can let him \"pick\" the \"string\", and when he grabs and directly breaks the \"string\", the floating island is immediately destroyed!","Raising his hand, Roy saw that there were countless such strings extending from his body. These strings that swayed slightly like green smoke were intertwined with the strings that originally existed in this world, completely indifferent to each other.","Roy actually noticed a different eye structure from the moment he became a demon. At least when he was born as a human, he couldn't see the soul at all, but as a demon, he could noticed. In addition, there is dark vision, the ability to see clearly in darker places is completely different from humans.","Roy did not answer him, but looked at his demon's claws with some fascination, and muttered to himself \"So that's the case, the power of disturbance? Or is this the so-called authority!?\"","Roy didn't answer them, but thought carefully for a moment, and suddenly looked at the wreckage of another floating island in the distance.","Roy didn't feel any magical fluctuations, nor any elemental invasion, but the wreckage was destroyed under the eyes of everyone. Julia and the others who saw this scene looked at each other, not knowing what was going on.","Roy looked at him and grinned and said \"Don't worry, I also know that you will not do anything for me again. My promise is still valid. Next time you meet, you will face the ‘void’!\"","Roy raised his hand and attempted to use his magical power to condense a piece of ice in his palm. To his surprise, he witnessed an extraordinary force field emanating from his palm. However, upon contact with the force field, all the elemental particles, possibly including water, converged swiftly, gathering in his palm. Through a series of continuous squeezing, fusion, and meticulous arrangement, the invisible microscopic particles underwent a remarkable transformation into visible matter. Consequently, a diamond-shaped piece of ice materialized in the palm of Roy's palm.","Roy's eyes have undergone a lot of evolution afterwards. Compared with other demons, he has more radiation vision. Therefore, the world scene that Roy sees in his eyes is naturally indescribable. But even so... the world he saw before and the world he saw after the integration of the godhead was completely incomparable!","So when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse came to Roy, the first person in the war spoke with a stinky face \"demon, this is the only time and the last time, don't think about using us to deal with the enemy for you!\"","String, let's call it that way, because it is composed of somewhat translucent, void, and ethereal threads. These countless threads are intertwined vertically and horizontally to form a sheet that covers the entire sky, and even covers the sky. The big net of the whole world!","The previous self-detonation caused by Jubileus’s fall blows almost everyone away a long distance. Fortunately, this is heaven, with this vast empty space, so the power of self-detonation did not make everyone suffer. What a big injury, but the gap where they were blown out happened to be used by Roy and directly got the Eyes Of the World of Jubileus, so that the face of the war was very ugly at this time.","The reason why the word \"string\" suddenly comes to mind is because when Roy saw these misty threads, the first thing that came to his mind was puppets! Because the two of them looked like they were being caught in his eyes at the moment. Like puppets connected by countless wires...","The unique force field formed by magic power was invisible to Roy in the past, but now, he deeply understands how the medium of magic power communicates elements. This was observed in a microscopic situation. Roy raised his head slightly and looked into the distance. The vertical pupil at the center of his brow shrank slightly, just like a magnifying glass was pulled away. Breaking out of the microscopic vision, Roy saw the macroscopic scene.","The white part of the eye of this demon's eye is entirely red, with a dazzling feeling. Only the narrow and long pupil in the middle is covered with a touch of gold. The whole eye looks very strange, which makes people feel chilly and hassle. A strange sense of holiness...","There really is the so-called \"string of fate\"!.","They certainly knew that Roy had merged with the Eyes of the World and became the new demon king, but the demon was the most difficult creature to trust. They didn’t know whether they were doing it right or not, but if Roy became the demon king, he wanted to treat these two The world is unfavorable, so their grandfather and grandson are fighting for their lives to stop Roy.","This big net floods the world and makes all people and things shrouded in it, including Julia and Benia, who are close at hand, and there are many similar lines that seem to extend from their bodies. Coming out, it is the same as the countless threads intertwined in this world.","This kind of change is difficult to describe in words. There are microscopic and macroscopic ones. In the microscopic view, Roy saw countless particles flooding the atmosphere, and these particles emit a completely different light. If you can identify them, Roy is very I quickly understand that these newly-appearing particles are actually elements! Endless elements flood the entire world, as if doing Brownian motion, colliding, merging, and then separating irregularly.","With the help of this eye, everything Roy sees at this moment has undergone tremendous changes.","Yes, a sense of sacredness! This word appears to be the most inappropriate adjective for creatures like demons, but it just appeared..."]},{"l":"Change Note","p":["Julia -> Junia","Benia -> Baina","Morbius Ring Godhead -> Morbius Mark","The term \"Godhead\" may not refer to Jubelius's Morbius Mark, as it is incomplete and Roy decides to temporarily store it in system space with the intention to give it to Julia.","It could possibly refer to the \"Eyes of The World\" possessed by Jubileus to awaken her.","Godhead -> Eyes of the World","Silas -> Sareth (Foster Sons)","Julius -> Jubileus","Beyonita -> Bayonetta","Fall -> Void","Referring to the corruption in the Darkside World, which Roy refers to as the \"Void,\" similar to the term used in World of Warcraft.","Sparta -> Sparda","The father of Dante and Vergil"]}],[{"i":"491---power-contract","l":"491 - Power Contract","p":["\"Don't look at me like that!\" Roy said to Sparda \"This is the heavenly world, so the situation is fine.

As Bayonetta's best friend, she felt that she should take precautions and not sign a contract with the same demon.","Dante snorted and choked back \"The person you are talking about is you, right?\"","For Roy, the sacred soul of high-ranking angels is not very useful, because it can't satisfy the appetite, and can't be used to absorb and increase the magic power. He is different from those fanatical demons who take the task of destroying angels as their own. He lacks the sense of honor that belongs to the demon alone, but even if he can’t use it, the sacred soul of high-level angels is actually a resource. Now Roy has entered the Demon King level, he is also considered the top class in the abyss world. This type of resource may be possible. It might be used to exchange good things with other demon kings.","Fortunately, Roy did not really ignore it, because for him, separating the two fused purgatory spaces again is just one thing that can make him familiar with the power of \"authority\"...","Hearing Roy's words, Sparda heaved a sigh of relief and nodded \"I hope you don't mind, Osiris... Your Majesty! After all, I have been in the human world for a long time. To me, the human world here is equivalent to the first Two hometowns, I really don’t want it to be hurt...\"","If Bayonetta wants to borrow Roy's full power, then every time she borrows it, she needs to enshrine at least thirty sacred souls to Roy! This number is already a lot, even if the heavenly world here has a long history, it is difficult to gather so many four-winged angel souls...","In fact, Bayonetta had been looking at Roy's current appearance before, and now she immediately shook her head when she heard this, and said, \"It's not easy for those angels to kill us. You don't need to worry about this, but...if you can If you do, I hope to sign a contract with you, allowing me to borrow your power in this world.\"","In the end, Virgil said first \"It's useless, Dante, haven't you discovered it? Even if the Demon World is really sealed, there will always be people in the human world who will try to open the seal.\"","Julia retrieved the origin of her soul, and Roy himself also successfully obtained the Eyes of the World and the Mobius Mark. His purpose of coming to this world this time has been achieved, and it can even be said to be over fulfilled.","Moreover, they also believe that people like witches who have dealt with demons for a long time will not be unaware of the dangers of demons. They should be more cautious in dealing with demonic power. The power signed by Bayonetta and Roy. The contract, perhaps more to increase the hole cards, to prevent angels from attacking them...","Only by standing shoulder to shoulder with the gods, can they do this with supreme mighty power. This is why they still gather around Roy, but they are most anxious now that Roy is not willing to do such troublesome things. After all, the demon does they really do based on their liking...","Roy is not very familiar with the control of authority now, so he can't wait to return to the Abyss. For him, Sparda and Dante worries are completely unnecessary.","Roy was in a good mood at the moment, so he smiled jokingly \"Hmph, don't you worry, without me, those guys in the Demon World would be overwhelmed by no one?\"","Roy was noncommittal about Sparda's decision. He couldn't control what the world would become after he left, so he turned his head to look at Bayonetta and Jeanne.","So when he heard this, Dante became a little irritated and grabbed Sareth, rubbing his red hair into a mess.","Soon, the contract was completed. At the moment when the power contract was completed, Roy clearly felt the position of the contractor Bayonetta and the spatial connection with him. In other words, if Roy has studied space power a little deeper, and maybe through this contractual connection, he can appear next to Bayonetta, thus bypassing the detection of the will of the world, and appearing in Bayonetta's world in a special way. .","Sparda and the others silently watched Bayonetta and Roy sign the contract, and did not say much. Although they felt that it was dangerous for humans to borrow the power of the demon or even the demon king, this is after all the world where the witches are and where they are. There is nothing to do with the world of the two twin worlds. The connection between the two twin worlds lies mainly in the connection between the purgatory space. As long as the witches do not cross the boundary, there should be no problem.","Sparda looked suffocated, and smiled bitterly \"That's for sure. Several demon lords are dead. Madam Styx and the others may follow you back to the abyss world. After losing the leader, the demons who come from behind will take the opportunity to compete. Power and territory, the Demon World will probably be in chaos for a while.\"","Sparda took advantage of this gap and finally said \"No need to seal it up, Dante and the others will be responsible for clearing away the demons that entered the human world...\"","The next thing is logical. Roy and Bayonetta signed a power contract. The content of the contract stipulates that Bayonetta can only borrow Roy's power in this world, and this borrowing is hierarchical. Level, every tenth of the power, after borrowing once, Bayonetta must enshrine the souls of three high-level angels, and these souls are at least four-winged angels, and the 100% higher the borrowed power, The corresponding worship will also be doubled.","The two brothers stared at each other and froze for a while, then turned their heads together and snorted.","The voice hadn't fallen yet, and Sareth had a weird expression beside him \"By the way, this decision you made was not because you didn't want your son to lose his job, right?\"","Therefore, re-separating the purgatory space of the two worlds is the most important thing for Bayonetta and Dante.","These two witches actually gave Roy the feeling that they were better than Sparda. After all, as the contractors, the witches and demons have more connections. Roy said, \"Even the ancient angels, here is the kingdom of heaven. It should also be in contact with the high-level heaven. The archangel Jubileus has fallen. This is definitely a big event for the high-level heaven. Maybe it won’t be long before a new angel archangel will be sent to you. Come to the world, you witches will definitely become the biggest targets by then. Do you have any thoughts on this?\"","This is naturally a loophole in the rules, but unfortunately, Bayonetta obviously knows the existence of such loopholes. As a witch who has signed power contracts with many demons, such loopholes are It is easy to find out, so Roy's feeling only lasted for a second or two, and then disappeared in the next moment. He could no longer accurately perceive the spatial position of Bayonetta!","This may be caused by Bayonetta's use of a secret method unique to the witch...","Whether it’s the heaven of Bayonetta’s world or the demon world of Dante’s world, the purgatory space of the two twin worlds was one before, but after all, they have been separated for so long. If it really happens again The fusion will have an enormous impact on the two twin worlds. Not to mention that the living space of angels and demons will be affected by each other, which will lead to a continuous and protracted battle. I am afraid that I will fall into unimaginable chaos.","Yes, Dante is a demon hunter.

Looking for nodes that he could grab with his hands, when he found a place to apply force. After he found the node, Roy's claws suddenly clenched, and the muscles of his arms swelled up like an explosion. The power of authority gathered in his palm, holding the two nodes, and he violently tore it!","\"If your Majesty has nothing to do with him, what use is it for you to rush up!?\" Benia also shouted at Julia \"Calm down, we can only trust him now, after all, now he has a Eyes of the Word, Maybe it has the ability to resist the erosion of the void power!\"","\"That's the Void!!\" Benia said in a panic, \"I should have thought of the space bubbles in the two purgatory spaces, which originally existed in the void! There was nothing wrong with the previous two space bubbles fused together. Now Osiris pushed the two spaces away and immediately exposed the void!\"","\"Then, what should I do!?\" Julia was also anxious, and shouted at Benia \"That's our king! Our partner!\"","\"What!?

With his wings spread wide, Roy soared slowly along the border of tangled information, simultaneously brandishing these grotesque demons. Utilizing the authority imbued in his claws, he commenced dismantling the entangled information. The others lacked Roy's Eyes of the Word, preventing them from perceiving the world he observed, thus peering at him curiously from a distance. His movements seemed like wild gesticulations to the air, creating an eerie sensation.","[3] The three pairs of demon wings behind Roy opened as he entered the state of true name liberation. In this state, he noticed that, apart from his fused Eyes of the Word, his entire body had undergone a transformation. It had grown larger, and even the wingspan had significantly increased. The three pairs of wings now extended widely, creating a sensation of dominating the sky...","A bang sound erupted, as if it was coming from the entire space, instantly resounded in the minds of all the creatures in the purgatory spaces on both sides!","Although Roy does not have the authority to create, he wants to separate the two spaces and does not involve anything that needs to be created. However, correspondingly, he cannot delete and destroy the entangled spatial information at will. Roy has to do It is to help untie the entangled information and sort them out to make them distinct, so that the two spaces can be completely separated.","And what appeared with this loud noise was a black crack in Roy's location! Countless black lightning, like a shower, rushed out of the cracks, and immediately enveloped Roy's whole body.","As soon as she heard the word \"Void\", Julia's mind immediately buzzed, and the next moment she flew up in desperation, trying to rush to Roy's location.","Before everyone recovered from Roy's feat of tearing the space apart, they saw this scene first, so that Benia immediately looked shocked and couldn't help screaming \"No! Osiris is in danger!\"","Dante and the others looked awkwardly at the emotional excitement of Julia and Benia. For them who did not understand the terrible power of the void, of course they would not understand why Julia and Benia would treat those black lightnings. So scared...","During this period, there were also some defying angels who attempted to attack Roy, but they were all intercepted by Sparda, allowing Roy to comb through information on both sides of the world without any distractions.","For the so-called \"authority\", Roy himself does not know what kind of power it is.","He even guessed that those gods who had mastered the power in the past were afraid that no one would be able to say exactly what this power should be called.","He had tried to control these “strings” before, but found that many “strings” he could not move at all. The only ones that could be manipulated by Roy were only a few “strings”, and it was difficult to manipulate. There are also high and low.","However, before she could fly, she was hugged by Benia and rushed down from mid-air. Benia said to Julia \"Are you crazy!? You rushed over like this, instead of letting him Osiris not distracted!\"","However, in the process of actual use, Roy still found some differences. This so-called administrator authority is not omnipotent!","If Roy’s guess is correct, these strings are really the underlying information of matter. Then the Eyes of the Word is the key that gives Roy the key to \"seeing\" these low-level information. It is precisely because of the integration of the Eyes of the Word that Roy is qualified to control these. Low-level information.","In other words, it seems that he can only delete data, but cannot create data...","In the state of true name liberation, Roy found that his ability to manipulate string information has become much easier. It seems that in the state of true name liberation, the growth of the soul also leads to the growth of the Eyes of the Word...","It’s very strange that when the two purgatory spaces overlapped, some bizarre and weird phenomena often appeared in this heavenly world, but as Roy continued to sort out, these weird scenes became less and less. After Roy was completely sorted out, everyone saw a very obvious skyline appearing in the kingdom of heaven.","Moreover, it is also the destruction and destruction of the underlying data. Roy found that certain information was easy to delete, and some were more useless. It took Roy to spend time to carefully identify the specific information.","Needless to say, this is an unimaginable great spectacle, so much so that the angels and demons that still exist sporadically, like Sparda and them, all looked at the miraculous scene that subverted their imagination.","Of course, through the operation of destroying those floating island wrecks just now, Roy himself also vaguely had a little judgment of his own. This kind of \"string\" pervading everything seems to be some kind of \"information\" or \"data\". Kind, but also the basic underlying \"information\"!","Once he understands what the information is, Roy will also be able to understand what the authority he controls.","Roy didn't even think that his job would last for three days!","Roy is of course not clear about why this is happening. He can only speculate that it is caused by his own demon body.

Although the war is over, there are still sporadic angels in the kingdom of heaven. They need to guard against possible attacks by these angels and not let them disturb Roy.","The real \"administrator\" authority may be the so-called creator. He should have all the authority to modify, create and delete all information at will...","The space is torn apart!","There is no doubt that this is a more troublesome process, Roy looked at the countless entangled string information, and regretted it a little bit.","These are all speculations that Roy has imagined based on his previous human knowledge. Roy can't tell whether this is the case, but the speculation is similar.","They are the necessary basis for the formation of matter, weight, volume, external color, and the influence caused by interaction with the outside world, etc. All these information are entangled together and form a string-like information.

If you put it in human computer terms, it is that every who has authority over power is actually not a real one. \"Admin administrator authority\" should be ordinary \"user authority\".","This feeling is as if the Eyes of the Word has given Roy the authority of an \"administrator\", and Roy was promoted to the authority ​​at once [2]. In this sense, it is not to call this kind of power \"authority\". It's quite appropriate...","This fusion of the two purgatory spaces, as a whole, is the superposition effect of space. This superposition is invisible to the naked eye. Before changing to the Eyes of the Word, Roy was also powerless, but it is different now. With the help of the Eyes of the World, Roy’s field of vision can clearly distinguish the two types of string information that are present in the world with obvious differences. Now these string information are messily entangled like fishing lines. It does not reflect the regular network structure of normal space.","This is a separation phenomenon that is unique to space. It is because the two purgatory spaces are not regular when they merge, so this kind of curvy marginal effect appears. On both sides of this line, one side belongs to the heavenly purgatory space, full with the soft power of holy light. On the other side belonged to the Demon world space, filled with dim ashes and storms.","This skyline is not the flat, two-layered skyline that we often see before, but a strange and slanted line, which is such a strange skyline, which brings the entire heavenly world into one.

They could no longer see Roy's figure, he could only see a huge black plasma ball floating there, endless auras of madness and destruction, constantly permeating from this black ball, even the ubiquitous soft holy light in the heavens was swept away by these auras .","During the time in the abyssal world, Roy has been thinking about this issue. He thinks that Lilith’s words have a reason. If the void power represents \"nothing\", then the elemental power represents \"thing\"!","Even in some human folklore, she is the ancestor of vampires, the origin of vampires...","For so many years, there has been no progress, which made Roy have some doubts whether the so-called Chaos Force really exists.","Fortunately, Julia was stopped by the calmer Benia...","Fortunately, this erosion did not happen overnight, which naturally gave Roy a chance to breathe.","He hasn't forgotten what Lilith once said, only the power of chaos can fight the power of the void!","However, just when he was about to withdraw and evacuate, suddenly, Roy found that all the magic loops on his body were pulsing.","However, Lilith not only paid attention to it, but even entrusted Roy with a heavy responsibility, giving him the task to get the egg of the Red Sea, not to mention, she also explained the Chaos Demon to Roy in great mood.","However, things like chaotic power may be easy to separate, but it is more difficult to regroup together. Roy has been trying to fuse these circuits since he opened up the magic circuits of all elements. But Roy himself didn't know what went wrong. He can now use various element magic alone or cast some mixed element magic, but he has never been able to use all the element magic.","It is precisely because of this special inertia that most of the world can exist safely.","It's no wonder that when Roy tried on his own in the past, he couldn't integrate all the elements. It turned out to be lack of special environmental conditions...","Lilith, in many legends, is a very special existence. She is the first female demon in the abyss world and the ancestor of the succubus family. Not only does she maintain a close relationship with all the demon kings, but she also have have relationship with Angles. It is said that Demon King Samael used to be an angel. It was precisely because of his marriage to Lilith that he left the Garden of Eden and came to the abyssal world to become a demon.","Not a fusion of one or two, but a fusion of all elements!","Now, this suspicion has become a conviction. Because Roy discovered that under the tremendous pressure of the erosion of the void power, all the magic circuits in his body began to resist, and all the elemental powers in the magic circuits appeared at this moment. Signs of fusion!","Only at this moment, when Roy was accidentally exposed in a void in the rift and was corroded by the power of the void, he suddenly understand all the previous things!","Roy doesn’t quite understand what the picture seen by Lilith, a prophet who can observe the future, looks like, but it should be countless possibilities, just like Doctor Strange in thousands of possibilities. Just as he found the only option that could defeat the Purple Sweet Potato Spirit, Roy felt that Lilith must have seen a similar picture, having successfully defeated the erosion of the void and gained the power of chaos.","Roy no longer intends to run away. He knows that such an opportunity is simply a huge opportunity of a lifetime. The void rifts exposed are not huge, and the power of the void that swarms out has not reached the point where it is completely irresistible. Once he miss it, it may never encounter such unique environmental conditions again.","Roy now faces two choices. One is to give up and continue to separate the two purgatory spaces, and immediately escape and return directly to the abyss world, but the consequence of doing so is that this void fissure will never be closed, and it will continue to spray. Void power emerged, corrupting and eroding the two purgatory spaces, and then continued to spread to the human world.","Roy was very suspicious for a time. When Lilith saw herself, did she see something in the long river of time? so she liked herself so much...","She is considered to be the first wife of the ancestor Adam of mankind. She is Eve, but she left the Garden of Eden because of dissatisfaction with Adam, and later became a female demon who seduced humans and strangled babies.","The void forces Roy has seen and contacted are manifested in the form of creatures or objects that erode and infect the material world, and then these infected people accelerate the destruction and destruction of the material world, even in the Darksiders World, The void in the Demon King City is so huge that it only eats up the space where the Demon King City is located bit by bit, and did not destroy it all at once. It can be seen that this kind of power has a special power. Lazy!","The void is like a piece of paper, or a black background board. Thousands of worlds and the universes and spaces that contain them are all depicted on this background board. Only when the universe and space of the world appear or only when it is damaged can you see the black on the background board, exposing the existence of the void.","There are so many features that make it impossible to distinguish what kind of existence Lilith is. However, as far as Roy understands, the Lilith in the Darksiders world is undoubtedly very powerful, because she has The ability to control time!","There is no doubt that the power of the void, like black lightning, is now trying to corrode him. By infecting the creatures of the material world, the power of the void can survive in the material world. If the real Roy is corroded, then he will immediately Will be transformed into a void creature, even with his current rank, he will become a void lord, and then directly swallow these two twin worlds...","Therefore, Roy gritted his teeth and supported it, desperately urging the magic circuit in his body to operate, even if the whole body came from the maddening tearing pain, he did not care, but his eyes showed a touch of... fanaticism.","These thoughts were all thought of in Roy's mind for a moment, so he didn't panic too much, but immediately mobilized the magic power of his whole body to protect himself, and at the same time observed these swarming void forces through the eyes of the godhead.","To be honest, the sudden emergence of the void at this time was something that Roy did not expect. It is different from Benia’s understanding of the power of the void. In Roy’s understanding of the power of the void. The void is actually not that easy to erode a world, even if His method of tearing apart the two space bubbles is a bit rougher, and the same is true.","Void power is a chaotic and violent force dedicated to turning the material world into nothingness. It is the common enemy of all material worlds. It sounds terrible but in essence...","What Roy has to do is to make this picture a reality!","With a move in his heart, Roy temporarily stopped his intention to evacuate, and quickly began to carefully perceive the magic circuit in his body."]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["Name Changes","Bynea, Bainia -> Benia","Julie -> Julia","Dark Blood world -> Darksiders World","Devil -> Demon","Spartans -> Sparda","Silas -> Sareth","Have to rewrite this whole paragraph"]}],[{"i":"494---where-are-my-nails","l":"494 - Where are my nails?","p":["\"I don't know, it doesn't seem like it...\" Julia and Benia looked blank.","\"Is this a success or a failure?\" Dante's hand stretched out to his back involuntarily, holding his double guns.","\"It's been a week...

The moment Roy tried to enter, it seemed like the whole world. All the power was concentrated, and Roy flew out fiercely.","Nero also said \"Although I don't want to admit it, Sparda... Grandpa did lie to your foster father...\"","Nothing! So for Roy, the Demon World here can only be regarded as a third- and fourth-tier city. Where can there be a first-tier big city like Abyss?","Of course, the aftermath of this event is indelible in the human world in a short period of time, subverting ordinary human cognition and the phenomenon of the Three Views. This time it can be said to be witnessed by the whole people, and it is impossible to even explain it with hallucinations. It may not be long before all kinds of weird religions in the human world will rise, using their own imagination and understanding to try to explain what happened this time, and the rise of these religions is bound to affect the scientific development of the human world will caused a huge impact...","On the other side, Roy, who returned to the Demon World, took a deep breath and said to Sparda, \"The air here is much more refreshing!\"","Sareth seemed to have thought about it, so he deliberately fell behind and said to Dante at the end \"Dante, Nero, are you going to re-seal this abyss entrance?\"","Seeing Sareth leaving, Vergil stepped forward and said to the people with some doubts \"In fact, I have always had a question, is Osiris we encountered this time really a demon? I have never heard of it. Which demon will help us stabilize the world and his righteous son is such a child of taboo son with a good personality... I feel surprised no matter how you think about it...\"","Seeing the demons follow Roy one by one, the four Sparda grandparents didn't know what they were thinking.","So after thinking about it, Roy stopped struggling, and greeted Julia, Sparda and the others \"Go, go back to the Demon World!\"","So many unknowns aroused Roy's curiosity, and he can't wait to explore now.","Sparda shook his head and said, \"This is my second hometown. All my descendants are here. They are all children of taboo. If I go back to the Abyss World, I will definitely be targeted!\"","Sparda's words to Roy were understood as a pure abyssal demon's reserve and pride in the bloodline, so he did not dare to speak. As everyone knows, Roy really has no interest in this world, no matter how vast the demon world is, Can there be an abyss and the world is vast? Can the Demon World have a spatial channel connected to the Ten Thousand Realms like the Abyss World?","The strength of this blow, if I had to describe it, would not be less than millions of tons of strength...","The two beautiful young ladies look at each other. With a charming smile, the next second, the sound of endless gunfire sounded again, allowing golden blood and feathers to float in the heavenly sky again...","The two fusion purgatory spaces are torn apart along the boundary, and given a little inertial force. The two purgatory spaces begin to separate slowly. After this step, Roy has basically succeeded. It only takes a while and the two purgatory spaces will return to their original positions. It will re-wrap the human world of the two worlds and restore to the complete world as before.","The void power that emerged from the void rift was neutralized by Roy’s chaotic body. This caused the void rift to be powerless after the evolution of Roy’s bloodline and was closed again, so Roy's next operation no longer has to worry about opening the void rift.","This also means that Roy's journey in these two twin worlds has come to an end...","To be honest, Roy was also a little confused about this situation. Of course, he also knew how difficult it is for a Demon King Demon to enter a main world, but he did not expect it to be so difficult.","While Roy separated the two purgatory spaces, the various weird phenomena that appeared in the human world on both sides have completely disappeared. People can no longer see the projection of angels and demons, nor can they see the scene of the two fighting each other. Don't worry about falling into the space cracks and entering the dangerous purgatory space anymore.","With that said, Roy couldn't help but think of Rodin. That guy is Mephisto's clone, but he can stay in the human world. From this point of view, there is actually a way for Roy to go to the main world. You only need to create a clone with a lower power level to represent him in the past."]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["There is a word \"Yingyingzhuozhuo\" and i don't know what it mean, i just delete it."]}],[{"i":"chapter-496---510","l":"Chapter 496 - 510"}],[{"i":"497---this-is-a-bit-embarrassing","l":"497 - This is a bit embarrassing","p":["\"How could this happen?\" Julia said madly \"The gates of the abyss have expanded into this way, why is Osiris still stuck!?\"","\"No way, his current strength is too strong...\" Benia said helplessly and proudly.","[2] A group of individuals soared through the air while Fat Tiger's massive figure sprinted diligently on the ground not far behind.

The cause of this worries is the flares are about to be mined. The warehouse is full, but the lord has not yet returned. They don’t know whether to continue to expand the warehouse or find a way to trade these flares...","For some demons who have lived for a long time, this is about two thousand years.

The energy given to the gate of the abyss was only able to accommodate him passing through at that time, but he never expected that it was fine when he went, and when he came back it was upgraded.","If you don’t want to be so stuck in the space tunnel, Roy has only one choice, and that is to use his power to directly break through the abyss gate and squeeze in forcibly, but this may cause the abyss gate to explode.

It looks like the soul of Archangel Jubileus, you really have almost digested it!\"","Mephisto’s incarnation has so many images in the world, so that no one knows what his real body looks like, so no one can say whether the body in front of him is his body. Okay. Roy didn’t struggle too much, and he said directly “I thought Rodin said, I’m afraid it will be a couple of hundred years later. I didn’t expect you to find it so soon. Let’s talk about it. whats the matter?\"","Roy nodded and didn't speak. When he first met Rodin, he discovered that Rodin's clone actually already had the power of the Demon King rank. In such a situation, it is really hard to tell who is the clone and who is the main body.","Roy was also a little surprised when he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. Sareth didn’t say anything clearly when he hurried to find him, so he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. At first glance, Roy felt that his eyes were blurred.","Seeing Roy also turned into a human appearance, Mephisto looked a little surprised, but then immediately laughed again and said to Roy \"Look, we actually have a common language, don't we?\"","The angels of high-level heaven always don't want to kill these demon kings all the time, but unfortunately, in the same long eternal battle, both sides will win each other and can only maintain a delicate balance.","The volume of the fog was so large that after Roy appeared, he looked at Mephisto condescendingly, but Mephisto was not at all annoyed, but looked up at Roy's body with interest.","The waiting time is a bit long, but Mephisto has been waiting very quietly. I don't know how long it has passed. A smile suddenly appeared on his face, he stood up and said, \"Here\".","There is no doubt that this is what Roy looked like when he was a human. During the period of retreat, he was finally able to control his foggy body to simulate other images. Now I see that Mephisto is also a human. He naturally subconsciously imitated his original appearance.","Thinking of this, Roy walked to the throne in the hall and sat down, tilted his head and looked at Mephisto, motioning for him to also sit down, and then said \"No wonder Rodin told me at the time that we would meet again soon. It seems that at that time he shared the memory with you in the Book of Changes, right? So, you really are the ontology?\"","Unlike Roy, the demon king who just came to power, the second generation of demon kings have existed in the abyss world for a long, long time. This long time is at least calculated in units of ten thousand years. In such a long time, this The second-generation demon kings of the second generation naturally also gained a reputation among the ten thousand realms. Their resounding names are not only spread in the abyss world, but also spread throughout the human world and the heavens.","When Roy met Rodin in the world of Devil May Cry before, Rodin called himself Mephisto. Since he dared to call himself this way, it means that Rodin is a clone of Mephisto, but this matter is only Roy and Rodin. [3] Roy didn't mention it to Julia and the others afterwards, so when they heard the name suddenly, Julia and Benia seemed so surprised.","Within the Ten Thousand Worlds, numerous opportunities and potential dangers exist, and Roy has learned to exercise caution. Over time, ancient demons and angels have shown him the consequences of carelessness. As a successor, if Roy fails to internalize these lessons, he would truly be foolish."]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["Name Changes:","Belie -> Belial","Belie has been changed to Belial, who is known as the King of Lies in The Demonic Paradise and also appears as Lord Belial in Mairimashita! Iruma-kun.","Civilized rod -> Walking Cane","Regarding a close name for Andariel, considering the exclusions of Demon Kings that has been mentioned (7 deadly sins, Mephisto, Baal, Diablo, and Belial), there are three potential options: Astaroth, Abaddon, and Azazel. Choosing among them is challenging. However, let's exclude Leviathan from the question.","There are instances where the pronoun \"I\" appears frequently, but it very out of context.","The meaning of this paragraph kinda lost, but the overall idea is that Roy is skeptical about Mephisto's invitation to join him in overcoming obstacles when traveling to other worlds. I rewrite it tome make it more readable."]}]]
