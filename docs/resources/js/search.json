It looks like they can’t wait to return...","\"What are these lines?\" Roy thought strangely, \"Could it be that these are the so-called lines of fate?\"","\"What's wrong?\" Julia and Benia didn't know what was going on. They just watched Roy inexplicably raise his hand to destroy the wreckage of the floating island, but now they frowned and asked curiously.","After about ten minutes, Roy seemed to have caught something, and the dancing fingers suddenly squeezed together. In the next moment, Roy saw the remains of the floating island with an area of ​​thousands of square meters in the distance suddenly cracked and turned into countless dust.","After hearing Roy's murmurs, Julia and Benia's eyes filled with astonishment. While they were aware of Roy's fusion with the Divine Spark, they had not anticipated him mastering it with such swiftness. He had grasped the power of authority.","After seeing the departure of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, Roy shifted his gaze towards Sparda, Dante, Virgil, and Nero. In the present moment, all four of them remained in their demonic forms, maintaining a watchful and vigilant eye on Roy.","All of this stems from the different eye structures between creatures.","Amidst the gaze of everyone present, Roy detected no magical fluctuations or signs of elemental intervention, yet the wreckage succumbed to destruction. Witnessing this perplexing scene, Julia and the others exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what was unfolding before them.","As Julia and Benia stared in surprise, a gap opened in the center of Roy's forehead as he squinted his eyebrows. His tough demon skin seemed to have been cut with a knife and it slowly spread to both sides, revealing a newly emerged demon's eye inside.","Attempting to explain these changes becomes a challenging task. These visions manifest on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. In the microscopic realm, Roy witnesses a multitude of particles permeating the atmosphere, radiating a distinctly unfamiliar light. It becomes clear to Roy that what he observes are elements—countless elements inundating the world, engaging in a ceaseless dance akin to Brownian motion. They collide, merge, and separate in irregular patterns, creating a mesmerizing spectacle.","Divine Spark is a good thing, but this kind of good thing falls into the hands of a demon, that’s another matter. Even if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were summoned by Roy, this doesn’t mean they would like to see Roy. A new Demon King is born.","Eyes are the only way most creatures use to observe the world. However, in the eyes of different creatures, perhaps they observe the world differently.","Fortunately, Roy didn't have anything to do with these twin worlds...","Frogs are highly sensitive to moving objects in nature, but their vision is less clear when they are stationary. Most insects possess compound eyes, making it difficult to comprehend their visual perception. Snakes have limited vision but rely on thermal detection to locate prey. Human eyes can perceive a visual image of 576 million pixels and discern approximately 1 million colors, even though color blindness and color weakness are common. The mantis shrimp, on the other hand, exhibits exceptional color discrimination ability, being capable of distinguishing up to 16 colors, including ultraviolet and infrared rays invisible to humans. Additionally, they can detect linearly and circularly polarized light. However, as the mantis shrimp lacks intelligence, it remains elusive to describe the world they perceive through their eyes...","However, after destroying the wreckage, Roy frowned, and thought \"It's not right, it shouldn't be like this\". He saw that the floating island wreckage itself spread after being destroyed. The string that came out has not disappeared but changed to another form and continues to blend into the strings of this world.","In addition to the world and colors observed, there are many more things Roy can't describe in the macro scene. It may be a special ray that was difficult to perceive in the past. Roy can't tell for a while. Something, but the most special thing is that Roy saw... strings!","In some literary works, there are often such sentences and adjectives \"The goddess of fate has plucked the strings of fate\". Roy didn't think there was anything in this sentence before, but now he saw these illusory threads with his own eyes. Roy suddenly discovered that perhaps this sentence may be true.","In the past, Roy was unable to perceive the invisible force field generated by his magical power. However, he now possesses a profound understanding of how magic power serves as a conduit for elemental communication. This realization occurred within the realm of microscopic observation. Roy tilted his head slightly, gazing into the distance. The vertical pupil at the center of his brow contracted, mimicking a camera lens, and changing his visions to a microscopic perspective. Roy beheld the macroscopic scene unfolding before him.","In the sky, four vigorous steeds came in the air, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse came slowly towards Roy on their respective mounts. Farther away, Bayonetta and Jeanne also stepped on their feet. The magical aperture is constantly jumping, rushing towards this side.","In this feeling, it is great! Roy can feel that it is a supreme power!","It was amazing. This kind of vision, seeing the whole process of magic forming with his own eyes was simply too mesmerizing for Roy. He never thought that the magic he had released in the past was made in this way.","Julia and Benia dared disturb Roy and watched Roy's movements silently. As Sareth, Dante, Nero, and the others returned, Julia and Benia brought their fingers to their lips, gesturing with a hiss, giving a hint to the group \"Don't disturb Roy.\"","Nevertheless, this time, Roy refrained from using magic. Instead, he cautiously extended his hand, with the five sharp fingers poised towards the wreckage, making a gentle, almost graceful dance.","No one knows what he did just now, only Roy himself knows. He has been trying to figure out a way to move the \"strings\" spreading out on the floating island. After trying for a long time, he finally found out. The root can let him \"pick\" the \"string\", and when he grabs and directly breaks the \"string\", the floating island is immediately destroyed!","Raising his hand, Roy saw that countless such strings were extending from his body. These strings that swayed slightly like green smoke were intertwined with the strings that originally existed in this world, completely indifferent to each other.","Roy did not answer him, but looked at his demon's claws with some fascination, and muttered to himself \"So that's the case, the power of disturbance? Or is this the so-called authority!?\"","Roy didn't answer them but thought carefully for a moment and suddenly looked at the wreckage of another floating island in the distance.","Roy looked at War, grinned, and said \"Don't worry, I also know that you will not do anything for me again. My promise is still valid. Next time you meet, you will face the ‘void’!\"","Roy noticed a different structure of his eyes from the moment he became a demon. At least when he was born as a human, he couldn't see the soul at all, but as a demon, he could. In addition, there is a dark vision, the ability to see clearly in darker places is completely different from humans.","Roy raised his hand, intending to utilize his magical powers to condense a piece of ice within his palm. To his astonishment, he observed an extraordinary force field emanating from his palm. Upon making contact with this force field, an array of elemental particles, potentially including water, swiftly converged and gathered within his grasp. Through a process of relentless compression, fusion, and meticulous alignment, the once-invisible microscopic particles underwent a remarkable metamorphosis, transitioning into tangible matter. As a result, a diamond-shaped piece of ice materialized in the palm of Roy's hand.","Roy's eyes have undergone a lot of evolution afterward. Compared with other demons, he has radiation vision. Therefore, the world scene that Roy sees in his eyes is naturally indescribable. But even so... the world he saw before and the world he saw after the integration of the Divine Spark was completely incomparable!","So when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse came to Roy, the first person who spoke is War, with a stinky face he said: \"Demon, this is the only time and the last time we help you, don't think about using us to deal with your enemy ever again!\"","String, let's call it that way because it is composed of somewhat translucent, void, and ethereal threads. These countless threads are intertwined vertically and horizontally to form a sheet that covers the entire sky, even covers the sky like a big net of the whole world!","The emergence of this new vertical pupil signifies the fusion of Mobius Mark from Divine Spark and Roy. Through this extraordinary eye, Roy's perception undergoes an immense transformation.","The reason why the word \"string\" suddenly comes to mind is that when Roy saw these misty threads, the first thing that came to his mind was puppets! Because the two of them looked like they were being caught in his eyes at the moment. Like puppets connected by countless wires...","The tremendous force unleashed by Jubileus's fall resulted in a powerful explosion that sent nearly everyone flying a considerable distance. Fortunately, being in heaven provided ample space, mitigating the impact of self-detonation on those affected. Although injuries were substantial, Roy fortuitously found himself blown into the exact location where he could seize Jubileus's Divine Spark directly. This turn of events significantly worsened the complexion of the ongoing war.","The white part of the eye of this demon's eye is entirely red, with a dazzling feeling. Only the narrow and long pupil in the middle is covered with a touch of gold. The whole eye looks very strange, which makes people feel chilly and unsettled. A strange sense of holiness...","There is the so-called \"string of fate\"!","They certainly knew that Roy had merged with Mobius Mark and become the new demon king, but the demon was the most difficult creature to trust. They didn’t know whether they were doing it right or not, but if Roy became the demon king, he wanted to treat these two The world is unfavorable, so their grandfather and grandson are fighting for their lives to stop Roy.","This big net floods the world and makes all people and things shrouded in it, including Julia and Benia, who are close at hand, and many similar lines seem to extend from their bodies. Coming out, it is the same as the countless threads intertwined in this world.","To verify whether his guess was correct, Roy looked around and found that there was a broken floating island on the far horizon. It was a small piece of debris from the floating island of Heaven that was crushed in the previous war. There are still countless wires connected, so Roy raised his hand to release a huge group of destruction flames, destroying it.","Yes, a sense of holiness! This word appears to be the most inappropriate adjective for creatures like demons, but it just appeared..."]},{"l":"Notes"},{"l":"Name Changes","p":["Julia -> Junia","Benia -> Baina","Godhead -> Divine Spark","Morbius Ring Godhead -> Morbius Mark","The term \"Godhead\" may not refer to Jubelius's Morbius Mark, as it is incomplete and Roy decides to temporarily store it in system space to give it to Julia.","Silas -> Sareth (Foster Sons)","Julius -> Jubileus","Beyonita -> Bayonetta","Fall -> Void","Referring to the corruption in the Darksiders World, which Roy refers to as the \"Void,\" similar to the term used in the World of Warcraft.","Sparta -> Sparda","The father of Dante and Vergil"]}],[{"i":"491---power-contract","l":"491 - Power Contract","p":["\"Don't look at me like that!\" Roy said to Sparda \"This is the heaven purgatory space, so the situation is fine. Once I enter the human world, even if I don't want to leave, the world will not allow it!\"","\"Hm...\" Roy rubbed his chin with his thick fingers, thinking for a while.","\"Oh!?\" Roy asked with interest \"So, what price are you willing to pay?\"","\"Old man, please seal off the Demon World again!\" Dante exclaimed suddenly, standing next to Roy.","\"You have a deal!\" Roy finally made a decision and said \"I allow you to borrow my power in this world!\"","After dealing with these things, the most important thing left is to find a way to separate the two purgatory spaces that have gradually merged.","At the moment when the power contract was signed, Roy felt the position of the contractor Bayonetta and the spatial connection with him. In other words, if Roy has studied space power a little deeper, maybe through this contractual connection, he can appear next to Bayonetta. Bypassing the detection of the will of the world and appearing in Bayonetta's world.","Bayonetta and Roy signed a contract of power, but Jeanne did not. As Bayonetta's best friend, she felt that she should take precautions and not sign a contract with the same demon.","Bayonetta had been looking at Roy's current appearance before, and now she immediately shook her head when she heard this, and said, \"It's not easy for those angels to kill us. You don't need to worry about this, but... if you can, I hope to sign a contract with you, allowing me to borrow your power in this world.\"","Dante snorted and choked back \"The person you are talking about is you, right?\"","For Roy, the sacred soul of upper-rank angels is not very useful, because it can't satisfy his appetite. It even can't be absorbed or used to increase his magic power. He is different from those fanatical demons who take the job of destroying angels as his main mission. He lacks the sense of honor that belongs to the demon alone, but even if he can’t use it, the sacred soul of upper-rank angels is a valuable resource. Now Roy has reached a Demon King level, he is also considered the top class in the abyss world. This type of resource may be possible to be used to exchange good things with other demon kings.","Fortunately, Roy did not ignore it, because for him, separating the two fused purgatory spaces again is just one thing that can make him familiar with the power of \"authority\"...","Furthermore, they hold the belief that individuals like witches, who have engaged with demons extensively, possess an acute awareness of the perils associated with demonic power. Consequently, they should exercise heightened caution when dealing with such forces. The power was sealed through a contract between Bayonetta and Roy, perhaps serving as an additional safeguard to ward off potential angelic attacks and bolster their defenses.","Hearing Roy's words, Sparda heaved a sigh of relief and nodded \"I hope you don't mind, Osiris... Your Majesty! After all, I have been in the human world for a long time. To me, the human world here is equivalent to the first two hometowns, I don’t want it to be hurt...\"","However, Virgil interjected, \"It's futile, Dante. Haven't you realized? Even if the Demon World were to be completely sealed, there will always be individuals in the human world who seek to break that seal.\"","If Bayonetta wants to borrow Roy's full power, then every time she borrows it, she needs to enshrine at least thirty sacred souls! This number is already a lot, even if the heavenly world here has a long history, it is difficult to gather so many four-winged angel souls...","Julia retrieved the origin of her soul and Roy also successfully obtained Mobius Mark. His purpose of coming to this world this time has been achieved, and it can even be said to be over-fulfilled.","Not giving Sparda finish his argument, Sareth interjected while making a questioning expression beside Sparda \"By the way, this decision you made was not because you didn't want your son to lose his job, right?\"","Only with having authority similar to God, Demon Kings can achieve this feat. This is why they still gather around Roy, but they are most anxious now that Roy is not willing to do such troublesome things. After all, the demon they do is based on their liking...","Roy doesn't comment on Sparda's decision. He couldn't control what the world would become after he left, so he turned his head to look at Bayonetta and Jeanne.","Roy is not very familiar with the control of authority now, so he can't wait to return to the Abyss. For him, Sparda and Dante's worries are completely unnecessary.","Roy was in a good mood at the moment, so he smiled jokingly \"Hmph, don't worry about that. But without me, those guys in the Demon World would be ruled by no one, right?\"","So when he heard this, Dante became a little irritated and grabbed Sareth, rubbing his red hair into a mess.","Sparda and the others silently watched Bayonetta and Roy sign the contract and did not say much. Although they felt that it was dangerous for humans to borrow the power of the demon, especially the power of the demon king, it might bring harm to the world. This is, after all, the world where the witches reside, their true domain. There is nothing to do with the world of the two twin worlds. The connection between the two twin worlds lies mainly in the connection between the purgatory space. As long as the witches do not cross the boundary, there should be no problem.","Sparda looked suffocated and smiled bitterly \"That's for sure. Several demon lords are dead. Madam Styx and the others may follow you back to the abyss world. After losing the leader, the demons who come from Abyss will take the opportunity to gain power and territory. The Demon World will probably be in chaos for a while.\"","Sparda took advantage of this gap and finally said \"No need to seal it up, Dante and the others will be responsible for clearing away the demons that entered the human world...\"","The next thing is logical. Roy and Bayonetta signed a power contract. The content of the contract state that Bayonetta can only borrow Roy's power in this world and this borrowing is hierarchical. For each increment of power that Bayonetta borrows, equating to every tenth of the total, she is obligated to offer the souls of three upper-rank angels as sacrifices. These souls must be of a minimum rank of four-winged angels. Additionally, for every 100% increase in the borrowed power, the corresponding tribute of souls is doubled. It is crucial to note that Bayonetta must adhere to this sacrificial practice each time she borrows power from Roy.","The two brothers stared at each other and froze for a while, then turned their heads together and snorted.","Therefore, the utmost priority for Bayonetta and Dante lies in re-establishing the separation of the purgatory space between the two worlds. This time, the only individual capable of achieving this feat is Roy, the newly anointed Demon King.","These two witches exuded an aura that made Roy perceive them as superior to even Sparda. After all, being the contractors, witches and demons held greater connections. Roy voiced his thoughts, saying, \"Despite its ancient, this realm remains one of the kingdoms of heaven. It should maintain contact with the High Heaven. The fall of the archangel Jubileus must be a big event for the High Heaven. It's possible that in due time, a new archangel will be dispatched to this world. At that point, you witches will become prime targets. How do you intend to address this impending situation?\"","This is naturally a loophole in the rules, but unfortunately, Bayonetta knows the existence of such loopholes. As a witch who has signed power contracts with many demons, such loopholes are easy to find out, so Roy's feelings only lasted for a second or two and then disappeared in the next moment. He could no longer accurately perceive the spatial position of Bayonetta!","This may be caused by Bayonetta's use of a secret method unique to the witch...","Whether it’s the heaven of Bayonetta’s world or the demon world of Dante’s world. The purgatory space of the two twin worlds was one before, but they cannot be one again. After all, they have been separated for so long. If it happens again, the fusion will have an enormous impact on the two twin worlds. Not to mention that the living space of angels and demons will be affected by each other, which will lead to the start of eternal war once again. Roy is afraid that it will run into unimaginable chaos.","With arms folded, Bayonetta declared, \"The price is the soul of an upper-rank angel! Trust me, even for a witch who has been in contact with demons, finding a powerful demon like yourself is a rarity. If we can strike a contract, I assure you that every time I harness your power, I will offer you the souls of three upper-rank angels in return!'\"","Yes, Dante is a demon hunter. In case the Demon World is sealed and there is no invasion of the demon, Dante is afraid that he soon will be poor..."]},{"l":"Notes"},{"l":"Name changes","p":["Julie -> Julia","Godhead -> Mobius Mark","Sparta, Spardan, Spardas -> Sparda","Demon Real -> Demon World","Refer to purgatory space at demon May Cry World, an outpost for demon","Abyssal -> Abyss","Silas -> Sareth","Beyonita, Bellonita -> Bayonetta","Joan of Arc -> Jeanne","Julius -> Jubileus"]}],[{"i":"492---exposed-void","l":"492 - Exposed Void","p":["\"After sorting out, the next step is to separate the two purgatory spaces!\" Roy thought this way while flying on the skyline. Looking for nodes that he could grab with his hands when he found a place to apply force. After he found the node, Roy's claws suddenly clenched, and the muscles of his arms swelled up like an explosion. The power of authority gathered in his palm, holding the two nodes, and he violently tore it!","\"All of you give me a room and don't disturb me. I need to concentrate!\" Roy said to everyone.","\"That's the Void!!\" Benia said in a panic, \"I should have thought of the space bubbles in the two purgatory spaces, which originally existed in the void! There was nothing wrong with the previous two space bubbles fused. Now Osiris pushed the two spaces away and immediately exposed the void!\"","\"Then, what should I do!?\" Julia was anxious and shouted at Benia \"That's our king! Our partner!\"","\"What!? What is that!?\" Dante asked quickly after hearing Benia's words.","<a id=\"fnref:2\" href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>2</sup></a> In other words, it seems that he can delete data, but cannot create it...","<a id=\"fnref:3\" href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>3</sup></a> Even though Roy lacks the authority to create, he possesses a degree of capability to separate the two spaces. This action, in essence, does not require authority to create. Correspondingly, he cannot delete and destroy the entangled spatial information at will. Roy has to untie the entangled information and sort them out to make them distinct and make the two spaces completely separated.","<a id=\"fnref:4\" href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>4</sup></a> The three pairs of demon wings behind Roy opened as he entered the state of true name liberation. In this state, he noticed that, apart from his fused Eyes of the Word, his entire body had transformed. It had grown larger, and even the wingspan had significantly increased. The three pairs of wings now extended widely, creating a sensation of dominating the sky...","<a id=\"fnref:5\" href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>4</sup></a> Roy's nails, sharp as stainless steel, glimmered with a cold light in the diffuse heavenly glow. With his wings spread wide, Roy soared slowly along the border of tangled information, simultaneously brandishing these grotesque demons. Utilizing the authority imbued in his claws, he commenced dismantling the entangled information. The others lacked Roy's Eyes of the Word, preventing them from perceiving the world he observed, thus peering at him curiously from a distance. His movements seemed like wild gesticulations to the air, creating an eerie sensation.","A bang sound erupted as if it was coming from the entire space, instantly resounding in the minds of all the creatures in the purgatory spaces on both sides!","Although Roy does not have the authority to create, he still wants to separate the two spaces and does not involve anything that needs to be created.","And what appeared with this loud noise was a black crack in Roy's location! Countless black lightning, like a shower, rushed out of the cracks and immediately enveloped Roy's whole body.","As soon as she heard the word \"Void\", Julia's mind immediately buzzed, and the next moment she flew up in desperation, trying to rush to Roy's location.","Before everyone recovered from Roy's feat of tearing the space apart, they saw this scene first, so Benia immediately looked shocked and couldn't help screaming \"No! Osiris is in danger!\"","Benia also shouted at Julia \"If our Majesty can do nothing about it, what use is it for you to rush up?! Calm down, we can only trust him now, after all, now he has a Mobius Mark, maybe it can resist the erosion of the void power!\"","Certainly, by destroying those floating island wrecks before, Roy gains a rudimentary understanding of authority power. The pervasive \"strings\" that intertwine everything appear to represent a form of \"information\" or \"data\". It seems that these strings serve as the fundamental essence of all underlying \"information\".","Dante and the others exchanged awkward glances as they observed Julia and Benia's emotional state. Unfamiliar with the overwhelming power of the void, they failed to comprehend why Julia and Benia reacted with such fear toward the black lightning.","During this period, some defying angels attempted to attack Roy, but they were all intercepted by Sparda and others, allowing Roy to comb through information on both sides of the world without any distractions.","However, before she could take flight, Benia catch Julia and swiftly descended from mid-air. With concern, Benia exclaimed, \"Are you out of your mind!? Your action will only disturb Osiris !\"","However, in the process of practical use, Roy still found some differences. This so-called administrator authority is not omnipotent!","If Roy’s assumption is correct, these strings are technically the underlying information of matter. Then Mobius Mark gives Roy the key to \"seeing\" this low-level information. It is precisely because of the integration of the Mobius Mark that Roy was able to control this low-level information.","In the state of true name liberation, Roy found that his ability to manipulate string information has become much easier. It seems that in the state of true name liberation, the growth of the soul also leads to the growth of the Eyes of the Word...","It’s very strange that when the two purgatory spaces overlapped, some bizarre phenomena often appeared in this heavenly world, but as Roy continued to sort out, these weird scenes became less and less. After Roy was completely sorted out, everyone saw a very obvious skyline appearing in the kingdom of heaven.","Moreover, it is also the destruction and destruction of the underlying data. Roy found that certain information was easy to delete and some were useless to even try. It took time and effort to carefully identify all of this information. Once he understands what the information is, Roy will also be able to understand what authority he controls.","Needless to say, this is an unimaginable great spectacle, so much so that the angels and demons that still exist sporadically, like Sparda and them, all looked at the miraculous scene that subverted their imagination.","Regarding the so-called \"authority,\" Roy himself remains uncertain about the nature of this power. He even speculates that even the deities who once wielded this power may have been unable to precisely define its true essence.","Roy didn't even think that his job would last for three days!","Roy is naturally unclear about the reasons behind this occurrence. He can only speculate that it is caused by his own demon body. After all, the power of the devil is always to dismantle and destroy, just as the creator created the demon to make them The same as the one to delete spam, the devil is the creator’s file shredder...","Shaking his head, Roy temporarily threw aside the mess of thoughts in his mind and began to concentrate on observing the world under his feet.","Sparda and the others nodded and dispersed, but they did not leave too far. Although the war is over, there are still sporadic angels in the kingdom of heaven. They need to guard against possible attacks by these angels and not let them disturb Roy.","The skyline before them is unlike the typical flat, two-layered skyline often observed. Instead, it takes on a peculiar and slanted form—a unique horizon that seems to bisect the entire celestial realm, dividing it in half.","The space is torn apart!","The true \"administrator\" authority, in this analogy, would likely be attributed to the so-called creator. Such an entity would possess the ability to modify, create, and delete all information at will.","There is no doubt that this is a more troublesome process, Roy looked at the countless entangled string information and regretted it a little bit.","These speculations came from Roy's imagination, drawing upon his previous human knowledge. Although Roy cannot ascertain their veracity, they align with his speculative understanding.","They are the necessary basis for the formation of matter, weight, volume, external color, the influence caused by interaction with the outside world, and many other information. All this information is entangled together and forms node-like information... like the internet.","This fusion of the two purgatory spaces, as a whole, is the superposition effect of space. This superposition is invisible to the naked eye. Before merging with Mobius Mark, Roy was also powerless, but it is different now. With the help of authority, Roy’s field of vision can clearly distinguish the two types of string information that are present in the world with obvious differences. Now these strings of information are messily entangled like fishing lines. It deviates from what it should have been.","This is a separation phenomenon that is unique to space. It is because the two purgatory spaces are not regular when they merge, so this kind of curvy marginal effect appears. On both sides of this line, one side belongs to the heavenly purgatory space, full of the soft power of holy light. On the other side belonged to the Demon world space, filled with dim ashes and storms.","This observation sheds light on the reason why individuals possessing authority over power exhibit distinct characteristics. In terms of human-computer analogies, it suggests that those with authority over power do not possess true \"admin administrator authority,\" but rather possess ordinary \"user authority.\"","This sensation is akin to the Mobius Mark endowing Roy with the authority of an \"administrator,\" instantly elevating him to a position of power. In this regard, labeling this unique power as \"authority\" seems fitting indeed. <a id=\"fnref:1\" href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>1</sup></a>","Three days later, when Roy finally sorted out the last string of information, he let out a long sigh of relief.","Upon attempting to manipulate these strings, Roy discovered that he could only control a limited number of them at once. Many of the strings remained beyond his grasp, proving challenging to manipulate. Furthermore, these strings exhibited variations in their accessibility and difficulty levels, ranging from high to low.","When experimenting with the power of authority, Roy made a significant realization. Unlike the archangel Jubileus, who possessed the ability to create strings of information seemingly out of nothingness, Roy, being a demon, lacked such creative capabilities. Instead, his influence lay in the capacity to dismantle and destroy these strings of information."]},{"l":"Notes"},{"l":"Name Changes","p":["Godhead -> Mobius Mark","Julius -> Jubileus","Sparta -> Sparda","Luo Yi -> Roy","Occasionally, Roy is mistakenly referred to as Lou Yi.

Although his strength improved rapidly when considering the lifespan of a demon, it still paled in comparison to Lilith, the demon king. In her eyes, his power was insignificant.","Amidst the plethora of magical theories, one fundamental principle remains: the elements serve as the foundation of the material world. This recognition is true, regardless of the uniqueness of any given material—it remains intricately connected to the evolution of the elements. While a solitary element may merely signify a fragment of the material world, the ability to unite all the elements signifies the embodiment of a complete material realm. It is within this theoretical framework that the basis for chaotic power finds its roots.","An alternative course of action entails enduring the erosion caused by the void forces and expeditiously restoring the two purgatory spaces to their original states. By doing so, the tempestuous space storm can be pacified, and the torn void rift will gradually mend, effectively sealing off the influence of the void forces. However, it is crucial to recognize that choosing this path entails potential risks. If Roy proves incapable of withstanding the corrosive nature of the void power, he runs the risk of succumbing to corruption.","As a demon, you don't even have to think about it. It's the first choice. Roy also thinks that his safety is first and there is no need to carry it out for these two worlds.","At that time Roy didn't think much when he arrived, but now looking back, Roy suddenly discovered that Lilith did this deliberately!","Benia rubbed Sareth's head and comforted him \"Don't worry, at least when we disappear, it may not hurt too much, and we will disappear in a blink of an eye...\"","Benia was right. If Julia rushed forward just now, maybe Roy and she would perish together. Fortunately, Benia stop Julia before it happens.","Black lightning shrouded Roy's body, violently radiating a terrifying and distorted scene around him. The Sparda in the distance had already been stunned at this moment. They could no longer see Roy's figure, he could only see a huge black plasma ball floating there, endless auras of madness and destruction, constantly permeating from this black ball, even the ubiquitous soft holy light in the heavens was swept away by these auras.","During his time in the Abyss world, Roy has been thinking about this issue. He thinks that Lilith’s words have a reason. If the void power represents \"nothing\", then the elemental power represents \"thing\"!","Even in some human folklore, she is the ancestor of vampires, the origin of vampires...","For so many years, there has been no progress, which made Roy have some doubts about whether the so-called Chaos Force truly exists.","Fortunately, this erosion did not happen overnight, which naturally gave Roy a chance to breathe.","Frankly speaking, the sudden appearance of the void at this particular moment caught Roy by surprise. It diverged from Benia's comprehension of the void's power. According to Roy's understanding, the void isn't capable of swiftly eroding an entire world. Although his method of tearing apart the two spatial bubbles may be somewhat crude, the outcome remains the same.","He hasn't forgotten what Lilith once said, only the power of chaos can fight the power of the void!","However, just when he was about to withdraw and evacuate, suddenly, Roy found that all the magic loops on his body were pulsing.","However, things like chaotic power may be easy to separate, but it is more difficult to regroup together. Roy has been trying to fuse these circuits since he opened up the magic circuits of all elements. But Roy himself didn't know what went wrong. He can now use various element magic alone or cast some mixed element magic, but he has never been able to use all the element magic.","It is precisely because of this special inertia that most of the world can exist safely.","It's no wonder that when Roy tried on his own in the past, he couldn't integrate all the elements. It turned out to be a lack of special environmental conditions...","Just as he found the only option that could defeat the Purple Sweet Potato Spirit, Roy felt that Lilith must have seen a similar picture, having successfully defeated the erosion of the void and gained the power of chaos.","Lilith, in many legends, is a very special existence. She is the first female demon in the Abyss world and the ancestor of the succubus family. Not only does she maintain a close relationship with all the demon kings, but she also has a relationship with Angles. It is said that Demon King Samael used to be an angel. It was precisely because of his marriage to Lilith that he left the Garden of Eden and came to the abyss world to become a demon.","Nevertheless, Lilith not only bestowed her attention upon Roy but also entrusted him with a heavy responsibility—the mission to retrieve the Red Sea egg. What's more, Lilith also explained the concept of Chaos Demon to Roy in a great mood.","Not a fusion of one or two, but a fusion of all elements!","Now, what was once mere suspicion has transformed into unwavering conviction. Roy has made a startling revelation: under the overwhelming onslaught of the void power's erosion, every magic circuit within his body has begun to rebel. Simultaneously, the elemental powers residing within these magic circuits have exhibited unmistakable signs of fusion.","Only at this moment, when Roy was accidentally exposed to a void in the rift and was corroded by the power of the void, did he suddenly understand all the previous things!","Roy doesn’t quite understand what the picture seen by Lilith, a prophet who can observe the future looks like, but it should be countless possibilities. Just like Doctor Strange in thousands of possibilities.","Roy no longer intends to run away. He knows that such an opportunity is simply a huge opportunity of a lifetime. The void rifts exposed are not huge, and the power of the void that swarms out has not reached the point where it is completely irresistible. Once he misses it, he may never encounter such unique environmental conditions again.","Roy now faces two choices. One is to give up and continue to separate the two purgatory spaces, and immediately escape and return directly to the abyss world, but the consequence of doing so is that this void fissure will never be closed, and it will continue to spray. Void power emerged, corrupting and eroding the two purgatory spaces, and then continued to spread to the human world.","Roy was very suspicious for a time. When Lilith saw herself, did she see something in the long river of time? so she liked herself so much...","She is considered to be the first wife of the ancestor Adam of mankind. She is Eve, but she left the Garden of Eden because of dissatisfaction with Adam and later became a female demon who seduced humans and strangled babies.","The void forces that Roy has encountered and experienced take shape as creatures or objects that corrode and taint the material world. These infected entities expedite the process of destruction, exacerbating the downfall of the material realm. Even in the Darksiders World, the vastness of the void within the Demon King City gradually consumes the space it occupies, rather than obliterating it all at once. This demonstrates the unique and relentless potency of such power. Truly awe-inspiring!","The void is like a piece of paper or a blackboard. Thousands of worlds and the universes and spaces that contain them are all depicted on this background board. Only when the universe and space of the world appear or only when it is damaged can you see the black on the background board, exposing the existence of the void.","There are so many features that make it impossible to distinguish what kind of existence Lilith is. However, as far as Roy understands, Lilith in the Darksiders world is undoubtedly very powerful, because she has the power to control time!","There is no doubt that the power of the void, like black lightning, is now trying to corrode him. By infecting the creatures of the material world, the power of the void can survive in the material world. If Roy is corroded, then he will immediately be transformed into a void creature, even if he is already a demon king. He will become a void lord and directly swallow these two twin worlds...","These thoughts raced through Roy's mind in a fleeting moment, causing him to refrain from succumbing to panic. Instead, he swiftly marshaled the magic power within his entire being, fortifying himself against the encroaching void forces. Simultaneously, Roy utilized Mobius Mark to closely observe the swarming entities of the void.","Void power is a chaotic and violent force dedicated to turning the material world into nothingness. It is the common enemy of all material worlds. It sounds terrible but in essence...","What Roy has to do is make this picture a reality!","With a move in his heart, Roy temporarily stopped his intention to evacuate and quickly began to carefully perceive the magic circuit in his body.","With unwavering determination, Roy clenched his teeth and hold himself, urging the magic circuit within his body to function relentlessly. Despite enduring excruciating, maddening pain that seemed to tear him apart, he paid it no heed. Instead, a glimmer of fervor gleamed in his eyes, reflecting his unwavering fanaticism."]},{"l":"Notes"},{"l":"Name Changes","p":["Bynea, Bainia -> Benia","Julie -> Julia","Dark Blood World -> Darksiders World","Devil -> Demon","Spartans -> Sparda","Silas -> Sareth"]},{"l":"RV Note","p":["Have to rewrite this whole paragraph<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-back-ref\">&#8617;</a>"]}],[{"i":"494---where-are-my-nails","l":"494 - Where are my nails?","p":["\"Did he fail?\" Dante's hand stretched out to his back involuntarily, holding his double guns.

It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a Titan body.","Fortunately, although these mists looked strange, they were indeed part of his body.

Roy can only focus on the changes in the body as much as possible, hoping that he can complete the magic circuit before he completely collapses. Otherwise, all of this will be means nothing.","In the beginning, Urgash the chaotic dragon of the heroic and invincible world, was tortured and mad. During his sleep and healing, the void power infected him. Although Urgash also resisted, in the long years, he Still declared lost, when Roy and the others left, Urgash had completely turned into a void creature, not only devouring the world of Ashan but also devouring the moon in the universe and the creation that healed in the moon.

Julia, Benia, Sareth, Sparda, Dante, Virgil, Bayonetta, and Jeanne have been watching from a distance. They dispelled all the angels and demons still in this space and prevented any creatures from approaching here.","Indeed, this humanoid mist was none other than Roy himself. After a lengthy wait, Roy finally witnessed the completion of the comprehensive transformation within his magic circuit. However, what took him by surprise was that following the alteration of his magic circuit, his body underwent a simultaneous... colossal metamorphosis.","Is this what they refer to as the Chaos Demon? It feels different from what I had envisioned...","Just when everyone didn't know whether to ask questions, the Fat Tiger holding Sareth suddenly sniffed forward with all three heads, and then made three","Now Roy is extremely fortunate that he has integrated Mobius Mark and been promoted to the Demon King's rank before directly contacting the void power. This has given Roy the confidence to resist the erosion of the void at the soul level. This may also be the reason that Urgash was able to persist in this way. For a long time, Roy wondered for a time if he hadn't had this Eyes of the World, would he declare a failure in resistance the first time he was exposed to the power of the void, and then fall completely?","One day passed quickly, and then two days, three days, a full week, Roy was stuck in the void of the void, always fighting the erosion of the void.","Only Roy himself was very unaccustomed. He stretched out his hands and looked at the gray mist flowing from the tips of his fingers, and couldn't help but make a sound.","Perhaps the existence of Ashan World can no longer be found in the Ten Thousand World. The spatial coordinates of that world are estimated to have become nothingness, leaving only a Void Lord Urgash entrenched there...","Physical pain and torture can be sustained with willpower, but Roy can only rely on the power of the Mobius Mark to resist the pain and torture of the soul.","Roy came back to his senses and quickly open the system interface. Fortunately, even if he has undergone huge changes now, the system has always existed, so he relived.","Roy found himself utterly bewildered in that moment, as he underwent an abrupt transition from his previous realistic appearance to a distinct Cthulhu style. Moreover, the mist that enveloped his form retained an ink painting-like quality, adding to the surreal nature of his transformation. The magnitude of this profound change, transpiring within such a brief period, caught even the devil off guard.","Roy hadn't removed his true name liberation for a long time, because the time he takes was too long from his expectation.","Roy only temporarily woke up from the entanglement after he noticed that someone was approaching and saw that it was Julia and the others.

The body and soul have suffered maddening pain and torture at the same time. They may be able to resist it for a while, but if it takes a long time, Roy estimated that the twin world will also embark on the old road of Urgash.","Sareth immediately understood what was going on, and said excitedly \"It's a foster father!

Devoid of a nose and mouth, there were only three golden-red glowing orbs atop its head, resembling eyes. While these eyes bore some resemblance to Roy's, a notable discrepancy arose from the presence of a single pair of enormous mist wings behind the humanoid form, rather than Roy's original three pairs.","The original solid muscles and bones turned into a fog, and even the blood was gone.

Otherwise, the ramifications could have been unimaginable.","Don't talk about nails, even the demon horns on Roy's head turn into a fog.","Everyone felt a little better...","Having said that, you may have guessed it, yes, it is precisely because all the elements are now in Roy's body in a quantum state, so Roy can indeed use any elemental magic without any hindrance. Because elemental quantum can be transformed into any elemental magic!","However, in the eyes of people who are more knowledgeable like Sparda and Benia, Roy's actions just now are so terrifying!","However, the truth is that concepts like quantum are not overly complex. When a physical quantity possesses the smallest indivisible fundamental unit, it becomes quantized, with this tiniest unit referred to as a quantum.","In simpler terms, quantum refers to the process of subdividing an entity to its irreducible point, where its fundamental components cannot be further divided. Starting from cells, then delving into nuclei, atoms, molecules, neutrons, protons, electrons, and so forth, this progression continues until reaching a point of indivisibility. At this level, the particle is commonly referred to as a quantum.","In truth, Roy also discovered that, combined with the changes in his pedigree in the system panel, the fog on him is composed entirely of many elements.","It can be said that Roy’s body is now composed of the most basic units of the elements. These strange and mysterious mists are composed of trillions of elemental quantum.

Despite Roy's current transformation, he had managed to endure the erosion of the void. Moreover, they observed that the progression of the void had slowed down significantly. The void rifts were sealed shut, and there was no trace of void power remaining on Roy's body. This indicated that Roy not only triumphed over the void's erosion but also reversed the process, expelling the void power from within himself.","Julia is smiling, sighing in her heart. From the time Roy became a high-ranking demon and she knew her, she felt that Roy had always been better than the demon of the same rank.

If this is the case, I am afraid that the chain reaction caused can directly destroy the entire purgatory space of the heavenly kingdom... I did not expect to be able to do it so easily...\"","Roy found that after turning into this misty state, it seemed that he had acquired some special abilities, but it was not the time to explore these abilities at the moment, so he could only wait to return to the abyss world.","So if the element particles are split until they can no longer be split, can they also be called quantum?","Such a powerful destructive force, even for the rest of the demon kings, it is not easy to achieve it, right?","The answer is yes, Roy's current situation is because all the element magic circuits in the body are completely integrated. To receive a coexistence, these elements undergo a spontaneous division, fragmenting into the most fundamental units of their composition. This transformation process even extends to Roy's own body, altering its very nature.","The darkness is so pure, but apart from that, there is no other vision. Compared with the magic used by Roy in the past, the effect is a bit simple and unpretentious. Such a dark cube stood there.","The fall of Bayonetta and Jeanne made Roy come back to his senses, realizing that their present situation is related to him, so he can only calm down and restrain his emotions.","The rest of the people also felt a little strange, feeling that Roy's attack just now was in great contrast to his weird form at the moment.","The same is true for demons. Demon’s horns are a symbol of male demons. When the demon’s horns were still there, Roy could not help but rub them.

If he doesn’t do anything, how can he pass this long time?","After gaining a Mobius Mark, being promoted to the rank of Demon King, and successfully evolving into Chaos Demon, Roy’s past insecurity has been eliminated a lot. He knows that from now on, there are not many things that can threaten his life. After the insecurity is eliminated, it is replaced by the desire to explore the unknown.","After Roy and Sparda disappeared into the space channel, Jeanne and Bayonetta, who were still in heaven, breathed a sigh of relief. Roy tried to enter the human world before. It really shocked the two of them. Fortunately, the rules of the world they were in were still very complete, which prevented Roy's actions. Otherwise, the two really didn't know what to do.","After showing his current strength a little bit, Roy felt very satisfied, so he refocused his attention on separating the two purgatory spaces.","After the grandfather and grandson stayed silent for a while, they took out their magic swords together and began to seal the channel of the abyss and the demon world...","After thinking about it, Roy stopped his thought, and greeted Julia, Sparda and the others \"Let's go back to the Demon World!\"","But Roy would not do this. He is now cautious about creating clones and will never create clones if it's not necessary. Even if Roy created clones, ROy must ensure that the clones can be completely under his control.","But these have nothing to do with Roy, he is ready to return to the Abyss.","Dante glanced at Sparda, nodded and whispered \"Yes, as long as this entrance still exists, there will always be demons from the abyss world entering the demon world again. We cannot guarantee that every demon that comes in will be righteous like your Foster Father and can communicate friendly...\"","Dante laughed, squatting down and looking at Sareth and then stretched out his hand to signal Sareth. Sareth also understood in seconds, so a big hand and a small hand were squeezed together.","Does the abyss world have an end? How many realms does it connect? Where are the other archangels and demon kings? What is High Heaven like? Does the creator of the angel and demon Titan truly exist? What's the matter with the void?","In fact, after separating the two purgatory spaces, Roy originally wanted to enter the human world. He want to see the human world where Bayonetta was, but unfortunately, when he tried to enter the human world, he was met with an unprecedented huge rebound.","In the face of the world’s repulsive effect, even if Roy used the power of the gods and authority, he was also rejected. The main world held incomparably deep malice against a powerful demon like Roy and would never allow him to enter that restricted area.","It is worth nothing compare to the Abyss! For Roy, the Demon World here can only be regarded as a third-tier or fourth-tier city. Where can there be a first-tier big city like Abyss?","It's fine as long as Roy stays in the purgatory space, but that's not the case in the human world. It didn’t feel obvious at first, but the rejection of Roy - the demon king, in the main world of Bayonetta and the others was unprecedentedly fierce. The moment Roy tried to enter, it seemed like the whole world's power was concentrated to reject Roy.","It’s fine if Sparda doesn’t accept his solicitation. Anyway, Madame Styx and the others, the demon lord, have been recruited by Roy. It doesn’t make any difference whether one more Sparda or one less Sparda, so he waved his hand and Roy stopped talking. Roy led everyone into the gate of the Abyss.","Nero also said \"Although I don't want to admit it, Sparda... Grandpa did lie to your foster father...\"","On the other side, Roy, who returned to the Demon World, took a deep breath and said to Sparda, \"The air here is much more refreshing!\"","Roy's chaotic body effectively neutralized the emerging void power from the void rift. As a result, the void rift became devoid of its destructive influence following the evolution of Roy's bloodline, and it sealed shut once again. With this development, Roy no longer needs to concern himself with the risk of reopening the void rift in his subsequent endeavors.","Sareth seemed to have thought about it, so he deliberately fell behind and said to Dante at the end \"Dante, Nero, are you going to re-seal this abyss entrance?\"","Seeing Sareth leaving, Vergil stepped forward and said to the people with some doubts \"In fact, I have always had a question, is Osiris we encountered this time really a demon? I have never heard of it. Which demon will help us stabilize the world and his righteous son is such a child of taboo son with a good personality... I feel surprised no matter how you think about it...\"","Seeing the demons follow Roy one by one, the four Sparda didn't know what they were thinking.","So many unknowns aroused Roy's curiosity, and he can't wait to explore now.","Sparda shook his head and said, \"This is my second hometown. All my descendants are here. They are all children of taboo. If I go back to the Abyss World, I will definitely be targeted!\"","Sparda's words to Roy resonated with unwavering pride and reverence for their Abyss's bloodline, so he didn't dare to speak. As everyone knows, Roy has no interest in this world, no matter how vast the demon world is, it has limited space and didn't connect to the spatial channel of the Ten Thousand Realms just like the Abyss.","The strength of this blow, if it had to describe it, would not be less than millions of tons of strength...","The two beautiful young ladies look at each other. With a charming smile, the next second, the sound of endless gunfire sounded again, allowing golden blood and feathers to float in the heavenly sky again...","This also means that Roy's journey in these two twin worlds has come to an end...","To be frank, Roy found himself somewhat perplexed by the situation. He was well aware of the challenges that a Demon King faced in entering the mortal realm, but he had not anticipated it to be this challenging.","Undoubtedly, the aftermaths of this event are indelible. Throughout the human world, ordinary human cognition and established perspectives undergo a swift and profound subversion within a short amount of time. This spectacle is witnessed by the masses and cannot be dismissed as mere hallucination. It is like an array of peculiar religions will emerge in the human world, each attempting to comprehend and interpret the inexplicable events that unfolded. The rise of these religions is destined to impact scientific progress in the human world, precipitating significant consequences.","While Roy separated the two purgatory spaces, the various weird phenomena that appeared in the human world on both sides completely disappeared. People can no longer see the projection of angels and demons, nor can they see the scene of the two fighting each other and didn't have to worry about falling into the space cracks and entering the dangerous purgatory space anymore.","With a bit of force, the two fused purgatory spaces are forcibly torn apart along their boundary. Gradually, the two purgatory spaces got separated. Having reached this crucial stage, Roy's mission is essentially accomplished. All that remains is to allow some time for the two purgatory spaces to revert to their original positions, seamlessly enveloping the human world within the two realms and restoring the world to its former completeness.","With that said Roy couldn't help but think of Rodin. That guy is Mephisto's clone, but he can stay in the human world. From this point of view, there is actually a way for Roy to go to the main world. You only need to create a clone with a lower power level and send it to the main world."]},{"l":"Notes"},{"l":"RV Note","p":["Roy mutter this to the will of the world that blocking to enter the main world<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-back-ref\">&#8617;</a>","There is a word \"Yingyingzhuozhuo\" and I don't know what it means, I just delete it.<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-back-ref\">&#8617;</a>"]}],[{"i":"chapter-496---510---mephistos-invitation","l":"Chapter 496 - 510 - Mephisto's Invitation"}],[{"i":"497---this-is-a-bit-embarrassing","l":"497 - This is a bit embarrassing","p":["\"How could this happen?\" Julia said madly \"The gates of the abyss have expanded so much, why is Osiris still stuck!?\"","\"No way, his current strength is too strong...\" Benia said helplessly and proudly.","<a id=\"fnref:1\" href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>1</sup></a> A group of people soars through the skies, while on the ground, you can spot Fat Tiger running, closely followed by a smaller hell-hound.

Having completed their adventure in the world of Devil May Cry, they return to their home.","Among the demons who have witnessed the passing of millennia, spanning approximately two thousand years, the news of the Frost Demon's reemergence as a lord circulates among them. When these ancient demons convene in private, they share nostalgic sighs and jestingly speculate about why the Frost Demon has yet to broach the subject of extinction.","As a result, the high-ranking demons in the management immediately flew towards the main castle, preparing to welcome the return of their lord Osiris.","As for whether that group of demons can capture a Frost Demon Lord, no one has ever doubted it, because anyone who has been in contact with this group of demons understands how terrifying the power behind this group of demons is...","Beside her, a male demon accompanied her in the form of a massive fire bull, emanating a commanding aura. Flames engulfed his expansive wings, and in his hand, he brandished a colossal sword of fire. Though he bore the appearance of a formidable hell master, his countenance now betrayed signs of panic as he hurriedly followed Mistress Julia, their escape route leading through the abyssal gate.","But soon, one figure after another appeared from the gate of the abyss. The upper demons quickly recognized the two first mistresses, Lord Julia and Lord Benia, then they also appeared behind them. Cassandra the Lich, and Sareth.","Calculating the time, it seems that demons will reappear in the abyss world soon...","Deep beneath the surface, an unusual sight unfolds. Countless demons toil diligently in this fiery domain. Squatting low, they employ their sharp devil's claws to burrow through the soil, fervently seeking something. Brilliant red flares, emanating scorching heat, are the object of their quest. After unearthing these flares, they diligently pile them into carts drawn by demon worms. These formidable creatures effortlessly haul dozens of tons of ore. Once the demon worms reach the banks of the underground river, coursing with molten lava, they arch their bodies and release the flares into the fiery flow.","Even during Roy’s absence, the mining work here has not been affected in any way, but recently the high-ranking demons who are responsible for guarding the warehouse are a little worried. The cause of their worries is the flares are about to be mined. The warehouse is full, but the lord has not yet returned. They don’t know whether to continue to expand the warehouse or find a way to trade these flares...","Fortunately, the upper demons are not stupid. They feel strange, but they can still see that the four more demon lords belong to their side. They dare not say anything, they can only flee in confusion...","Frostfire City, Roy's territory, the surface world here is still howling cold, the extremely harsh cold even the devil can hardly bear, so that almost no living creatures can be seen moving on the surface.","Having successfully escaped and widened the gate for a considerable duration, Julia and Benia gazed at the ultra-standard abyss gate in Frostfire City, their hearts gripped by worry and lingering fear.","However, Benia sternly warned them, \"Get back everyone, get back!\"","However, when they rushed to the gate of the abyss, they discovered that the area and area of ​​the gate of the abyss were unprecedentedly huge this time! The height alone has reached several thousand meters, and the area covered almost covers most of Frostfire City!","If Roy had not become a demon king now, he would have been a bit difficult to manage this group of demon lords...","In addition to these two demons, there are two other demons. Although they are smaller in size, there is no doubt that they both exude a strong aura.","In recent years, among the demons in the Fragmented World, there has been news that a new Frost Demon Lord was born. This Frost Demon Lord named Osiris has occupied a huge ice habitat in the Fragmented World as a Territory and was victorious in disputes with several other demon lords.","In the air, a female demon soars with two enormous butterfly and phoenix-tailed wings trailing behind her. Along her flight path, black and purple powders scatter, causing distress to any upper demons that come into contact with them. These powders contain a highly toxic substance.","In the dark, deep and silent bottom world of the abyss, fragmented spaces move randomly like Brownian motion.","It was indeed the Lord who had returned. The upper demons realize it and hurriedly flew forward to greet them.","Just when the upper demons were thinking about it, the gate of the abyss arranged in Frostfire City finally moved. The breath that belonged to the gate of the abyss was spreading, and the upper demons who felt this breath reacted immediately. This is the opening of the gate of the abyss, and it must be the Lord, Lord who has returned!","No one knows how many demon lords exist in this fragmented world, but there is no doubt that every relatively large fragmented world may be the territory of a demon lord. The demon lords use their powerful power to protect their own fragmented worlds, while at the same time fighting for territory with other demon lords openly or secretly. The winner lives and the loser dies. The cruel rules of the abyss world are also vividly reflected here and this over ten million years is the main melody in this fragmented world...","Only when you enter these fragmented spaces you will know that there are different small worlds. Some of these small worlds may be as small as a few squares of land, but some can be large enough to accommodate several cities.","Rafaro’s figure is flying in the sky. After going to Devil May Cry, his body has grown larger and slender again. This is because of the centipede lord that Roy kill. Scolopendra's soul was taken from Frostmourne and it was swallowed by Rafaro. It can be said that Rafaro now also has the same power as the Demon Lord.","So under this circumstance, the newly promoted Frost Demon Lord looks a bit different and unique, so some other Demon Lords are considering whether to find the location of the Frost Demon Lord first. In their opinion, it is estimated that this Frost Demon Lord will be captured by that group of demon forces in a short time and logically they'll be able to take his territory.","Such a huge gate of the abyss had never been seen by the upper demons before. They raised their heads in astonishment to look at the gate of this ultra-standard abyss, not knowing what had happened.","The demons are good at fighting and fighting, but it’s a bit difficult for them to do things like trading. Among the thousands of demons, they may not be able to find a few countable...","The four demon lords who were already under his command, along with Rafaro and Julia, born from the merger of Julia and Benia, brought the total number of demon lords under Roy's authority to six.","The fragmented world beneath is a world exclusively belonging to the survival of upper demons. Those who can enter and leave here are at least at the upper demon rank. However, the upper demons can only be regarded as residents here. The real ruler here is a demon lord!","The high temperature of the magma river can make preliminary refining of the ore. Impurities and soil will melt in the river, and the flares that can withstand the high temperature will emit a stronger red light, then move slowly under the flow of the river. After arriving at the second location of the mine, there will be flying fire demons salvaging these flares. After loading the truck, the demon worm will pull it back to the surface and store it in the warehouse.","The mining operation appears surprisingly well-organized, even though this operation manages by a demon. However, that is exactly what it is. Under the dominion of higher-ranking demons, the low-rank demons have become more compliant. Other creatures in this realm also stand taller, as they are accustomed to executing the orders of their superior demon overlords.","The resident of Frostfire though, What happened? Why did Lord Osiris go to a certain world from the Gate of the Abyss, and then suddenly four more Demon Lords came back after returning!?","The upper demons could only follow quickly. When they flew beside Julia and Benia, they discovered that there were more figures in the team that they didn't recognize.","The upper demons in Frostfire City looked at these four demons with trepidation. They were not ignorant people and they could see that they were four demon lords behind Mistress Julia and Mistress Benia.","This is a bit embarrassing...","Upon cautioning them to get back, the two mistresses swiftly proceed to enlarge the size of the Abyss Gate, allowing the people emerging from the other side to pass through rapidly. As if that something has gone wrong with this large gateway of the abyss.","Why is there such a discussion? That’s because the demon who is more informed knows that in recent years, there has been a special and powerful demon force that is capturing the Frost Demon group. As for what this demon force is doing to capture the Frost Demon, they don’t know much about it. They just know that the Frost Demon who was captured has never returned to the Abyss World...","Yes, no one would have thought that the first problem Roy, who had been promoted from the crown to the majesty after returning to the abyss world, turned out to be that he was stuck at the gate of the abyss..."]},{"l":"Note"},{"l":"Name Changes","p":["Endaz -> Scolopendra","Giant centipede that roy kill by trash it around like a little kid"]},{"l":"RV Note","p":["There is a name \"Fathu\", I assume this is Fat Tiger cause Cerberus sniffing Fathu's tail.

Who are you? This is the territory of His Majesty Osiris, what do you want to do here?\"","A true Demon King holds greater significance for demons than a mere Demon Lord. Every Demon King stands as an idol for all demons, commanding immense respect and admiration. In the hierarchical concept of demons, obeying a Demon Lord might position them as subordinates, but following a Demon King elevates their perception to that of a master, fostering a profound sense of loyalty and reverence.","After a while, Frostfire City which covers an area of ​​nearly a hundred kilometers, suddenly fell into a collapse. All the buildings, and even the ground nearly two kilometers below the surface, instantly turned into countless dust and particles, and in the space Under the contraction effect, they converged to a point in the center at once and then disappeared completely.","After Julia and the others came back to rejoin Roy, those high-ranking demons who had stayed in Frostfire City were surprised to find that the strange demon in front of them was their former lord.","After Roy got out, he also discovered this. He originally wanted to try to save Frostfire City, but then found that the space fragmentation was spreading to the entire fragmented world. As a last resort, Roy could only find a way to keep the space crack contain within Frostfire City, and not spread to a much larger area.","After the arm came out, Roy's entire body squeezed out, but his series of actions also caused the space channel constructed by the gate of the abyss to be completely disintegrated, and the violent sound of glass shattering spread throughout the entire space!","After the explanation, Roy turned into a flowing mist and plunged into the ground.","As per Roy's strategy, he intended to assign the four demon lords to protect Frostfire City from four directions to emphasize the importance of the Demon King City's central position.","As Roy hovered in the air like a mist, a sense of relief washed over him. Though he couldn't rescue Frostfire City entirely, he successfully prevented the fragmentation from spreading further. Roy had developed an affinity for this environment, even though his current bloodline surpassed that of the Frost Demon. He still cherished and adapted well to the cold and tranquil surroundings. Among the myriad fragmented worlds in the abyss, it wasn't effortless to find a location with the same vastness as this one.","At that moment, cold sweat broke out on his body, and he felt grateful that he hadn't acted impulsively upon encountering the human form of the mysterious figure. Otherwise, he couldn't fathom the consequences.","Back here, he used the power of the Red Sea Egg to fuse the legacy of Beelzebub, thus gaining the wind magic circuit and the power of the bug-type demon. It's a pity that Roy hasn't used this ability much before the promotion, but he has already completed the promotion of the Demon King Rank.","Benia nodded and said, \"Well, let us rebuild the territory next. You can concentrate on adapting to the various changes in your body. Besides...\"","Berial's bulging eyes widened suddenly, \"M-Mephisto!?\"","But then, they immediately felt the strong and coercive aura exuding from Roy's body, an aura that would make them fall to the ground and shiver and worship.","Facing a large number of demons, the old man still had a smiling face. When Berial saw him, he felt that something was wrong.","Hearing this, Berial, the overlord of Hell, interrupted and said \"If I find another territory, then I still like places with flames and high temperatures. It's too cold here...\"","If Roy walked through the gate that other demon kings left behind in the abyss world, the situation might be better, but he walked through the gate in the center of Frostfire City... because when he made the gate of the abyss, Roy still It’s just the rank of the demon lord, so he didn’t think too much at the time. The energy given to the gate of the abyss was only able to accommodate him passing through at that time, but he never expected it to accommodate a demon king.","If you don’t want to be so stuck in the space tunnel, Roy has only one choice, and that is to use his power to directly break through the abyss gate and squeeze in forcibly, but this may cause the abyss gate to explode. Julia and others understood this and led everyone to evacuate Frostfire City.","In the eyes of everyone’s worry, the widened gate of the abyss began to twist. This distortion knew that it had entered an unstable state. They knew that Roy had begun to forcefully break through the gate of the abyss, so they retreated subconsciously, far... far away.","It is not easy for a creature with extremely high energy in its body to pass through any door of space. The reason is that their energy often affects the stability of space. Now Roy’s energy has far exceeded the spec when the Abyss Gate was designed, causing him to be stuck even if the Abyss Gate was expanded to the limit.","It was originally, your boss Osiris is a Frost Demon, and the territory he is looking for must be a cold region. Even if you are a Fire Demon, you have to stay obediently...","Meanwhile, the old human man, who introduced himself as Mephisto, maintained a gentle smile as he continued to move slowly with his hand resting casually on his back.","On the contrary, Cassandra looked at Roy thoughtfully and said, \"Master, will you always be like this in the future?\"","Rafaro quickly issued a warning message for the first time, so it didn’t take long for the Hell Overlord Berial, who was guarding in this direction, to appear with a large number of demons, and surrounded the white suit old man on the ice field.","Roy in the misty state looked a little speechlessly at the densely packed demons crying and howling below him.

This is the bottom layer of the abyss world, how could a human appear!?","The gate of the abyss in Frostfire City was made by Roy himself.","The mist body is undoubtedly elegant, powerful, and convenient, yet the absence of a tangible form leaves Roy with a lingering sense of discomfort. He contemplates the possibility of researching, with the aid of the system, a way to re-utilize his original physical body.","The space collapse spanned across a vast circular area, leaving distinct and tidy edge marks beyond its reach. The once bustling city was now completely gone, replaced by a colossal round pit that marked its previous location.","The spatial fissures extended their influence to every building in Frostfire City, causing numerous cracks to form, akin to a photograph torn into countless fragments. Despite the fragments still holding together, the structural integrity of the buildings had been severely compromised, and it seemed inevitable that they would crumble to dust as the space collapsed.","Then Roy explained to the four demon lords, Madam Styx and Berial, asking them to find a place to settle down outside of Frostfire City. Roy allowed them to recruit their subordinates by themselves. After all, they are also demon lords, what would be a demon lord without subordinates?","There is no distinction between day and night in the fragmented world, and the passage of time is naturally not so easy to detect. Don’t know how long it has been, half a year or a year. In short, when the reconstruction of Frostfire City was about to be completed, a figure suddenly appeared in In this fragmented world.","Therefore, after discovering that their lord was successfully promoted to the demon king, all demons who stayed behind in Frostfire City became extremely restless. A fever and excitement filled their bodies, which could only be heard Roaring and dancing to vent their emotions.","These are some of the ability changes that Roy is currently faintly experiencing, but it seems that it is far more than these. So after drilling into the ground, Roy went all the way and soon came to the place where Beelzebub's carcass was discovered.","This guy was a little bit ignorant about his words, so Julia and Benia stared at him fiercely before his voice hadn't lost his voice.","This is a completely different sense of belonging!","This is a strange... human being!

The Abyss World once had the Demon King being sealed by a single seal for tens of thousands of years.

Although it was unlikely that he had ill intentions, the abyss world had always warned that one demon king should not encounter another, for the nature of the devil made it difficult to predict the outcome when two demons of such high stature meet. It was true that no one could guarantee it would turn out well...","However, in the last few thousand years, it has been difficult to see these seven new sin kings in the abyss world. It is said that among the news spread by the demons, these seven new sin kings seem to have fallen into a super high world. It's hard to get out, and stuck directly...","Ignoring this current situation, Mephisto could easily be mistaken for a genuine human gentleman; his demeanor exuded an air of sophistication that would surely deceive many.","In the Abyss, there are trillions of demons living, but only a dozen can stand at the top. But it's not the case for first-generation demons. The original demon represents the seven deadly sins. Besides Lilith, Queen of the Red Sea, there are several second-generation demon kings in the Abyss world.","In the blink of an eye, myriad mists materialized from the space, converging to form Roy's body.","It's just that... the passage of time has been so extensive that Roy can no longer recall his original appearance, which has led to this ambiguous visage. Nevertheless, his black hair and eyes remain distinctly discernible.","Julia was stunned for a while, wondering how Mephisto knew about it, but she cleverly didn't say anything.","Just like Julia, you would say that she is a clone of Jubileus, that's correct, but now that she gradually merges Julia's soul, then she becomes the body instead.","Lilim is another name for succubus, which means daughter of Lilith. The succubus has this name for the entire race, but nowadays such a name is rare, only those older demons, still maintain this tradition of calling succubus. Benia immediately realized that Mephisto in front of her might really be the old monster of the Abyss...","Mephisto has been waiting a bit long, but he has been quietly waiting. After so long, a smile suddenly appeared on his face, he stood up, and said: \"There he is\".","Mephisto let out a sigh of approval, \"Well, not bad!\" As he approached the gate of Frostfire City, he carried a walking cane, exuding an air of sophistication. Pausing for a moment, he gazed at Frostfire City, nodding in admiration at the splendid sight before him.","Mephisto, who looked like a human, glanced at Julia, a golden-red light flashed in his eyes, and seemed to use some power to observe Julia, and then said with a little surprise \"So it's you... My child, your power has gone a step further. It looks like the soul of Archangel Jubileus, you have almost digested it!\"","Mephisto’s incarnation has so many images in the world, so that no one knows what his real body looks like, so no one can say whether the body in front of him is his body. Okay. Roy didn’t struggle too much and he said directly “I thought Rodin said, I’m afraid it will be a couple of hundred years later. I didn’t expect you to find it so soon. Let’s talk about it. What's the matter?\"","Observing Roy's transformation into human form, Mephisto appeared mildly surprised, but quickly broke into a laugh and said, \"Well, it seems we share a common likeness now, don't we?\"","Roy nodded and didn't speak. When he first met Rodin, he discovered that Rodin's clone already had the power of the Demon King rank. In such a situation, it is really hard to tell who is the clone and who is the main body.","Roy paused, carefully examining Mephisto's persuasive expression, before breaking into a smile. \"Certainly, the idea of unhindered access to the Ten Thousand Realms is appealing, but wouldn't it be a simple matter to locate high-energy worlds on my own? Why would I require your invitation?\"","Roy was also a little surprised when he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. Sareth didn’t say anything clearly when he hurried to find him, so he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. At first glance, Roy felt that his eyes were blurred.","The angles of High Heaven don't always pursue their death, but at the same time, both sides will win and lose to the other side, resulting in a delicate balance.","The fog's volume was substantial, and as Roy reappeared, he cast a condescending gaze at Mephisto. However, to Mephisto's credit, he remained unperturbed and instead observed Roy's body with keen interest.","There is no doubt that this is what Roy looked like when he was a human. During the period of retreat, he was finally able to control his foggy body to simulate other images. Roy sees that Mephisto is taking the form of a human, making Roy subconsciously imitate his original appearance.","To welcome the arrival of the veteran Demon King Mephisto, Frostfire City immediately rushed out, and the four demon lords, plus Julia and Benia, came to greet Mephisto with many demons.","Unlike Roy, the demon king who just came to power, the second generation of demon kings have existed in the abyss world for a long, long time. This long time is at least calculated in units of ten thousand years. In such a long time, the demon kings of the second generation naturally also gained a reputation among the ten thousand realms. Their resounding names are not only spread in the Abyss but also spread throughout the human world and the heavens.","Upon entering Frostfire City, Mephisto wasted no time in being courteous. He toured the city, exploring its surroundings before eventually settling in the castle hall, right next to the throne. Carefully placing his cane beside him, he meticulously tidied up his well-groomed hair, as if getting ready for a formal meeting.","When Roy met Rodin in the world of Devil May Cry before, Rodin called himself Mephisto. Since he dared to call himself this way, it means that Rodin is a clone of Mephisto, but this matter is only Roy and Rodin. <a id=\"fnref:2\" href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>2</sup></a> Roy didn't mention it to Julia and the others afterward, so when they heard the name suddenly, Julia and Benia seemed so surprised.","While acclimating to this human body, Roy inquired of Mephisto, \"Have you somehow accessed Rodin's memories? And across such vast distances in time and space, can you still maintain a connection with your clone?\"","With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Roy took a seat on the throne in the hall and gestured for Mephisto to join him. \"No wonder Rodin hinted that we would meet again soon. Back then, he must have shared his memories with you through the Book of Changes, right? So, are you the original entity?\" Roy inquired.","Within the Ten Thousand Worlds, numerous opportunities and potential dangers exist and Roy knows this.

Indeed, he had noticed this before. For example, in the world of Van Helsing, it is said that Van Helsing died, and Gabriel’s soul fragments were also picked up by him. This is not at all. It is in line with the plot he knows, but the problem is that the world still exists, and it doesn’t perish or anything. The Heroic Invincible World is also the same. Because of his appearance, the plot that he knew has already changed beyond recognition, but Sareth’s original story The dark Messiah that should exist, is still living well in the abyssal world...","Mephisto leaned back behind the seat and put a finger up and said \"For example, if a human being, he has an imagination, imagined a bizarre story fragment, and this imagined story Fragments, he pondered over and over again, and even shared them with others to let more people know and be familiar with them. Then this kind of cluster consciousness may affect the will of the void, causing this story fragment to be born in the void.

He said \"Under curiosity, we have also tried to study human groups, and then we discovered an amazing fact, that It is that with the growth of human imagination, additional parallel worlds will appear!\"","Mephisto paused, let Roy slow down, and then continued \"Don't underestimate this conclusion.

You must know that the existence of many worlds can find their source in their literary works, but after our research, we found that, These worlds are not static, and human intervention may cause the evolution of these worlds to go in another direction instead of continuing to follow the development of the plot in the literary and artistic works!\"","Mephisto sighed, \"Because in the Middle Ages, although the Gate of the Abyss was also connected to the world, the world at that time was not as much as it is now, and it can even be said to be pitiful. At that time, once you go to other worlds, you will basically meet angels. As soon as the two parties meet, they will do a life and death. You can't avoid them. Although the eternal war is like this, but the time is too long, the same will happen. Tired, not only the demon, but also the angels.

It is estimated that Mephisto will leave and come to the Abyss World during this period of time. That plague angel [4] Malthael has already begun to be a demon, right? In that case, sealing the Dark Soul Stone of Diablo and the others is afraid that the seal will be lifted again, right?","As soon as he heard the name Gu Yi, Roy immediately reacted. Mephisto said it should be the Marvel world. No wonder he would say that there are many parallel universes there. This is definitely the Marvel world.","As the saying goes, I often walk by the river. How can I not wet my shoes? If you walk a lot at night, you will always encounter ghosts... These words probably describe Mephisto.","But such sacrifice rituals are not easy to talk about. The dark sect that believes in demons is the target of everyone in every world, not to mention that there are angels monitoring behind them. The abyss world can be sacrificed on a large scale during such a long time. Sacrifice summoning the demon king's rank in the past, it can really be counted with one hand.","However, after these conversations, Roy also roughly understood what the trouble Mephisto was talking about. A great devil, suppressed by a human, could not arbitrarily ruin the entire world, and could only hide in the main world. Relying on signing a contract to play with people, create a ghost rider to have some fun for himself (or take a son) and then wait for the ambitious son who wants to win a position to rebel against him, then release the ghost rider to hang his son.","However, there are advantages and disadvantages. The demon kings can take advantage of the loopholes to go to the high-energy world, but the opponents they have to face are also not comparable to the low-energy world. In a world with highly active psychic energy, intelligent life can master the power It will be stronger, various mages, warlocks, astrologers and the like emerge in endlessly, and the best of them are so powerful that even the gods can defeat them!","In the past few thousand years, Mephisto has not been going well either. He and his clone have selectively traveled to several high-energy worlds, but they all encountered powerful opponents without exception...","Indeed, in that Marvel world, there are abundant powerful existences such as the Purple Sweet Potato, Spiritual Group, and so on. More fierce than the Supreme Master...","Mephisto shook his head and said \"Of course not, don't get me wrong. I want to invite you to go, not this weird world, to be honest. The power of the Supreme Master is too strong. It's also said that outside the universe, there are more The existence of the supreme mage.

He has regained his original gentleman manner at this moment and said \"The clone of Rodin passed down to me in memory, this is one of them, And another more important reason is actually Lilith!\"","Mephisto stamped his walking cane to the ground bitterly, and said, \"That's right! It didn't take long for me to go to that world, and my two brothers and I were both tragically sealed one after another. It didn’t hold us for long, but it’s a shame for the devil! Those damn angels, they used humans and let them seal us with dark soul stones!\"","Mephisto, known as the king of hatred, is recognized as a big boss-level demon no matter in the abyss or in the heavens and the world. There is no doubt about this and his resounding is spread in many worlds. The name, his dark believers can be said to be all over the world.","Roy shrugged and did not answer the conversation. Of course he could hear that Mephisto was from his heart.","Such a situation seems to be a kind of rule itself, so even a veteran demon like Mephisto dare not say that he can really rampage in the world.","Sure enough, Mephisto then talked about the various situations of the clone in the Marvel world after he left, which seemed to pour bitterness on Roy.","The low-energy world is too repulsive to the Demon King's rank and the high-energy world is relatively better. That is because the mysterious psychic power in the high-energy world can be used by the general public and the psychic power is used much naturally.

Human beings are the most emotionally powerful species among all intelligent creatures. Since Mephisto has arrived, it is just right to follow the water and go to the world of Diablo and use the human beings in that world to find your own emotional power!","And when Roy had such an idea, he suddenly thought of Lilith. Lilith created the [2] Nephalem. Could it be that he wanted to reconcile the authority of the demon and the angel and reproduce the power of the Creator!?","As a demon, even if Roy has obtained the Eyes of the World and has the authority, his authority and power also tend to destroy and demolish. Like other demon kings, he has the ability to destroy a thing and an object from any level. Example for this \"Any level\", if you want to destroy a stone, you can smash it with a hammer, or you can throw it into the fire to melt it. These are all ways of destruction, Roy’s authority and power. It destroys it from the information level, such as directly changing the force between the stone molecules to make the stone become powder by itself or or directly changing the density of the stone to make it collapse inwardly.","As for the last reason, it is related to Roy's own authority.","Before he became a demon king, he had imagined the power of the demon king. He believed that emotions should also be a kind of regular power. However, after becoming the demon king, he discovered that what the Eyes of the World gave him was not the use of the power of the rules of emotion, but information.","Benia came up a little fascinated, and stretched out her hand to caress Roy's reverse wing. Compared with her own reverse wing, Roy's reverse wing appeared more sturdy and huge, and the hard texture was hard and full. The characteristics of a male demon, so Benia touched Roy's body while stroking her calf.","Consider this: the world of Diablo now brings together Mephisto, Baal, Diablo, and the upcoming Lilith. This means there are four demon kings present. If we include Baal, Azmodan, Andariel, and Duriel as the remaining four demon king ranks, there would be a total of eight demon kings. With so many demon kings gathered in one place, it is highly improbable that any of them would not possess a demon bible.","Does this mean that for the demon, the power of this negative emotion is the best medium for urging authority?","During the period of retreat, Roy has been studying the power of authority. This power that can manipulate the underlying information is a very new thing for him. However, during the research, Roy discovered that magic does not seem to be The best medium to drive the power of authority!","Everything in this world can be said to be strong and stable, but it can also be said to be extremely fragile, because once the many pieces of information that make up things are tampered with or removed, they will immediately lose stability and be destroyed.","He still maintains a human form, so this smile doesn’t look hideous, but rather gentle. This made Julie a little confused for a while, but she quickly recovered and said, “Of course I’m worried, because I always I think Mephisto seems to be pitting you!\"","However, it is not a simple task to bring objects to these two extreme temperatures. While it is theoretically possible to employ magic as a conduit, the process remains highly enigmatic. Whether it involves reaching the high temperature of absolute zero or 100 million degrees, an immense amount of magic power is necessary. Even as Roy now holds the title of Demon King, his resources are still limited. After extensive study, Roy started contemplating whether magic is truly the most effective catalyst to harness the power of authority.","However, why is every demon of the Demon King's rank given the name of mainly negative emotions?","In other words, she wants to recreate the Creator!?","Mephisto said that the egg of the Red Sea is Lilith’s placenta. Whether this sentence is true or false is unknown, but Roy has always had a guess that he thinks this thing should be the legacy of the creator, just like he brought it back. Like those demon bible steles, the old demon kings may at best be the first holders or users, but they are not the true creators.","Naturally, such thinking is to be expected, as magic has always served as the means to cast spells and has been considered the optimal catalyst and medium for channeling magical energy and the power of authority. However, upon deep contemplation, Roy was struck by an original idea.","Now, Roy does not possess all the Demon Bibles. Perhaps he can find others in the world of Diablo this time... This is the second reason why Roy agreed to Mephisto.","Roy believes that his guess should be correct. You must know that when the soul contains negative emotions, such souls are the most delicious for demons. The long-term pursuit of these negative emotions by demons can be said to be related to life. The inherent instinct, perhaps this instinctive pursuit, is to prepare for becoming a demon king after taking power...","Roy embraced her, kissed her fiercely, and then continued to speak \"Hmph, some of their ancients, old demon kings are all trapped in that world, why should I add another demon king in? Will he be able to solve the predicament? Mephisto came to me because he felt that I had just been promoted to the Demon King rank and when I was very proud, I would be easily fooled by him. Even though he kept saying that it was an angel united. Humans cheated them, but in my opinion, that world is definitely more dangerous than what he described.\"","So Roy asked himself What kind of negative emotion is the power I use to drive authority? What kind of name will I be called the demon?","The word pit was still learned by Julie from Roy, but when used here, she felt that the word was appropriate this time.","There are too many secrets hidden in the body of Lilith, the Demon. The Egg of the Red Sea that Roy brought back at the time seemed to be taken away by Lilith deliberately. Otherwise, it would be easy for Lilith to want to go back. But she didn't say anything, or even mentioned it.","This is the mighty power bestowed by the Eyes of the World on the demon kings and gods. Roy once suspected that the power of this authority was the original power of the Creator. It was only after the demons and angels that they were divided into two, and the demons had the information of destruction. And the angels have the power to create information...","This might be attributed to Roy being a frost demon. He has realized that he can manipulate the temperature of objects at will. He has the ability to lower the temperature to absolute zero, as well as raise it to a scorching 100 million degrees Celsius, akin to nuclear fusion temperatures at the time.","To be honest, Roy was shocked when he thought of this, and Lilith's sense of mystery in his eyes deepened...","With the passage of time, Roy discovered in the process of studying the power of authority that, among the many ways of destruction and destruction, his best at, or the best way to manipulate, turned out to be temperature!

However, due to the imprisonment of the soul stone containing Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, the church eventually succumbed to temptation and corruption. Nearly the entirety of the church fell under the influence of darkness, transforming into minions and servants of Mephisto.

It flew in all directions, and soon entered a state of invisibility and disappeared.","The high priest nodded and asked carefully \"Then about the agreement with my lord...\"","The news was quickly reported to the Horadrim Brotherhood. The fact that they failed to see the coming Demon King not only did not make the Horadrim Brotherhood feel relieved, but their faces became more and more ugly, because they were very uncomfortable. Know what this means this newly arrived demon king is not a fool, on the contrary, he is so cunning!","The wind was howling and the convoluted dark clouds were surging desperately, as if trying to cover the huge void in the sky. In vain, such efforts were obviously futile and the terrifying dark aura opposite the gate of the abyss was still radiating continuously surging.","These demonic eyes will soar to various corners of the world as per Roy's commands, relaying back their findings to him. This invaluable feedback will aid Roy in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the world's true state, ensuring that he remains untainted by any deceptions within this realm.","These pictures are all transmitted through the eyes of the devil. Under Roy's command, these invisible eyes of the devil have gradually found human gathering points scattered in various places in Sanctuary.","This kind of perception derived from the divine personality is very wonderful, but Roy is able to \"see\" it.","This kind of situation of repeated defeats and repeated defeats can no longer be described as a head iron. Roy does not know what purpose Mephisto and the others are so obsessed with in this world, but from the side, It can also prove how powerful the world's resistance to demons is!","This world... doesn't seem to be born naturally, but artificially created, because among these underlying information, there are many data that seem to be deliberately adjusted...","When Roy's body was completely descended, the gate of the abyss in the high sky slowly closed reluctantly, but the vision in the sky did not dissipate. Affected by the powerful strength of Roy, this area suddenly fell. There was a black blizzard, suddenly there were lightning flashes, thunder, and fire. The Zakarum cultists kneeling on the ground below, were smashed and screamed from time to time, but the screams were immediately swallowed by them, and they were covered in cold sweat.

Has the power been reborn once and counterattacked the High Heaven? After Diablo left, where did the soul stone go?\"","\"Soul stone?!\"","\"This is probably the real reason why they keep failing in this world!\" Roy concluded \"If this thing can seal the power of the Demon King, it means that it is also a dangerous item for me!\"","A part of the eyes of the demons who were sent to high altitudes came with a bird's-eye view of the world of Sanctuary. The world of Sanctuary is quite huge. It has two huge lands next to each other and around the land is endless. The entire world is also in the shape of a sphere, but strangely, when Roy ordered the demon eyes to keep flying upwards, he accidentally hit a thick barrier!","After all, angels and demons are intelligent creatures, and they have been fighting for too long. Naturally, like the world of dark blood, angels and demons began to get tired of the eternal battle.","After leaving the human gathering place, it is a different scene in the outskirts of the wilderness. Wandering demonic creatures, greed for blood and soul in their hungry eyes, wanting to kill any living creature they can see...","After tens of thousands of demon eyes were scattered on the two huge lands in Sanctuary, they also seemed very sparse, but as time passed, Roy also saw one by one in the picture. Human gathering points, these human gathering points are large or small, ranging from a few hundred people in a village to hundreds of thousands in a city. You can see the farmland that has been reclaimed on the periphery of the gathering area, and you can also see the shuttle in the gathering area. Caravans between lands.","Although an agreement has been reached with the heaven side, saying that they will no longer enter the world of Sanctuary, if the demon really abides by the agreement, it will not be called a demon, especially for an ancient demon like Mephisto. After seeing the great potential of the Nephalems, he thought of using the power of the Nephalems as a bargaining chip to overwhelm the balance of the eternal battle. So he, Diablo and Baal, the seven demon kings began to find ways to drill the loopholes in the agreement. Many years later, when the human mages in Sanctuary were studying magic, the hell demons tempted them, and let the human mages summon them from the purgatory space to Sanctuary again.","As a result, the demons began to invade the world of Sanctuary. They corrupted and seduced humans, the descendants of Nephalem, and used them to turn their heads against the angels. The power of Nephalem is both good and evil, so Being able to control them easily, the heaven side had no choice but to intervene in the affairs of the world again. The two sides began to burn the war from purgatory space to the place of sanctuary.","God Anu and Tathamet fought an eternal struggle, and in the end, the two creatures delivered the final blow, shattering each other at the same time.","Here, Roy encountered another revelation that left him perplexed. According to the historical records of Sanctuary, Lilith was revealed to be none other than Mephisto's daughter. Weary of the ceaseless conflict, she conspired with Inarius to steal the World Stone housed within the Chaos Fortress of the Purgatory Space. Utilizing the power of the World Stone, they established a refuge known as Sanctuary, where those angels and demons who shared their weariness of eternal warfare sought solace. It was during this time that Lilith and Inarius forged a deep bond, giving rise to a remarkable progeny born of both angelic and demonic heritage—the Nephalem, who became the first generation of humans.","His plan was successful. Affected by the decay of the energy frequency of the World Stone, the descendants of the Nephalems were unable to inherit the knowledge and power of their ancestors in their souls as before, so they began to weaken gradually.","However, Inarius, being a perpetrator of domestic violence, did not meet a favorable fate in the end. His act of stealing the World Stone branded him as a traitor in the eyes of Heaven. Eventually, a pact was formed between Heaven and Mephisto, where demons from the Burning Hells would no longer invade Sanctuary. As part of this agreement, Inarius was handed over to Mephisto as a traitor. Mephisto enacted a cruel punishment upon Inarius, severing his wings and reducing him to a frail, human-like figure. To ensure he could never escape his torment, Mephisto also removed Inarius' eyelids, forcing him to constantly witness his own decaying body. Inarius was confined within a chamber adorned with mirrors, where his twisted form served as a perpetual reminder of his wretched state.","Humans were unwilling to be destroyed by demons, so they also began to use the power of angels to expel the demons.","In a world where there are upper rank angels and many demon kings, these humans living in the Sanctuary can't see too much decadence and numbness. Human civilization can still have such vitality, which has to make Roy Amazed.","In the following history, it was recorded that Mephisto, Diablo and the other demon kings were sealed one after another. Roy immediately found the doubt after carefully checking these records.","In the history of Sanctuary, it is said that everything in this world comes from the creator God Anu. He is the only existence in the world, a existence intertwined with good and evil. He decided to purify himself and discard his evil in a dream. The evil that was abandoned eventually evolved into a seven-headed dragon: Tathamet!","In the prying eyes of the devil, Roy also saw the extraordinary power possessed by humans in the Sanctuary. There are mages who understand elements and magic, and there are crusaders who have obtained the power of holy light because of their faith and piety. There are also necromancers who study darkness and death, demon hunters who focus on lurking and assassination skills, and barbarian warriors who fight with powerful physical strength. These humans with extraordinary power have a unified name in this world are Nephalem!","Inarius was furious at this, because the Sanctuary was created by him and Lilith, and Inarius felt that he was the real king. Inarius exiled Lilith in a fit of rage and she was exiled to the purgatory space In the void beyond!","It is said that after the union of Inarius and Lilith, the first generation of nephalems was born. Because of their mixed blood, the nephalems were born with powerful powers, which even surpassed angels and demons. As time passed, the power they displayed also began to disturb the angels and demons of Sanctuary, so the angels and demons thought about clearing these Nephalem from Sanctuary.","It turns out that this Sanctuary is a lonely boat born in the ocean of purgatory space? No wonder when I saw the information of Sanctuary before, I felt that the information was artificially modified. It seems that this world was really \"made\"...","It's a purgatory space...","Lilith sensed the thoughts of these angels and demons, and felt that they dared to attack their own children, so in a fit of rage, she killed all the angels and demons in the Sanctuary.","Of course, this may also be related to the fact that the Seven Demon Kings were sealed and the Sanctuary ushered in a brief peace...","Roy did not let the Devil's Eye break through the barrier, because the breakthrough process may cause the Devil's Eye to be detected by the outer heaven or hell. Roy shifted his attention to other Devil's eyes.","Roy doesn't know if such a creation myth is true. In Roy's impression, the abyss is the origin of all demons. The demons of other worlds actually came from the abyss world at first, so this myth It seems that has a lot of fallacies, but after all, this is recorded by human beings. For them, there are too many illusions in the too long history, so it is normal to make mistakes.","Roy frowned. In the records, Mephisto and the other demon kings were all sealed by this thing. It is said that this soul stone is derived from the world stone, just like Inarius can adjust the world by adjusting the world. Just like the frequency of the stone to reduce the power of the Nephalem, the soul stone also has the effect of restraining and reducing the power of the devil. It is precisely because of the existence of the soul stone that demon kings like Mephisto Diablo, It can only be sealed in this world with hatred.","Roy nodded thoughtfully, and he realized that the purgatory space outside is probably the space where heaven and angle are located in this world.","Roy's Devil's Eye, in the books of some human gathering places, found the history recorded in the Sanctuary. The strange thing is that this war-torn world has a complete inheritance of history and in these historical places. In the records, Roy found the origins of the Nephalems.","Shaking his head and putting aside this strange thought for a while, Roy continued to check those historical books, maybe there was something wrong with the relationship between Lilith and Mephisto, but to say that Lilith created Nephalem, Roy Rather believe it.","Since coming and disappearing, Roy has been teleported in the coldest direction in the world. There is a lonely scene of ice and snow here. There are no signs of life activities within a radius of hundreds of kilometers, so Roy himself does not know where he is. Where is the place, but it doesn't matter, tens of thousands of demon eyes are constantly sending pictures towards him at the moment, so many pictures, Roy may not be able to deal with it in the past, but now he has After the quantum body, he found that his brain's ability to process information skyrocketed.","Since he came at the invitation of Mephisto, Roy didn't bring Julia and Benia together when Roy didn't know anything about the world of Sanctuary. Not only them, Roy also let Sareth and the fat tiger stay in the abyss world obediently.","So now in the world of Sanctuary, Roy is alone and it is very convenient to move.","That's what it means...","The seven dragon heads of Tathamet became the seven demon kings of hell, God Anu's spine became the crystal arch of the High Heaven, his eyes became a world stone with great power, and Angels and demons scrambled around the world stone and started the eternal battle.","The so-called Nephalem is actually the first generation of humans in the Sanctuary. There was no Sanctuary in this world. In the endless purgatory space, angels and demons staged an eternal battle that lasted for thousands of years. Unfortunately, The thing is, because the strength of the two sides is basically equal, no one can do anything about the other. The state of the two sides is divided into five and five, it can be said that the entire eternal battle has continued.","These angels and demons who are tired of the eternal battle are represented by the high-ranking angels Inarius and Lilith...","Thinking about it, Roy suddenly became crooked, eh? Maybe it's the kind of relationship called [2] Papakatsu?","This invisible barrier seems to be an incomparably huge barrier, which shrouds the entire world of Sanctuary, and even if the Devil's Eye does not pass through this barrier, Roy can feel it. Outside the barrier is a larger space, and this space is very familiar to Roy.","This is the origin of Nephalem in this world, which makes Roy look like a bullshit. You must know that in Roy's impression, Lilith is on the same level as the original sin demon kings, and her appearance is also the same as the original sin demon king. We were in the same period, and Mephisto, the demon king, was the next batch of demon kings. Even if he was also old enough, how could He dare to be Lilith's father? ?","This situation resembled a form of domestic turmoil. Following Lilith's exile, Inarius redirected his rage towards his own children. However, he also acknowledged that the immense power of the Nephalem surpassed his control. In an attempt to diminish their power, he manipulated the energy frequency of the World Stone, the cornerstone of Sanctuary.","When he saw these pictures, Roy really felt the cruelty of this world to humans.

Why come here to harm this world!?\"","\"Demon!\" The voice of Tyrael's soul came from the crystal stone, sounding a little furious, and said: \"What conspiracy are you imprisoning my soul!?\"","\"I have seen an interesting record in human history!\" Roy gave a wicked smile at the crystal stone, regardless of whether Tyrael could see it or not, and said, \"The Nephalem in Sanctuary After appearing, you, like the demons, had fears and worries about the powerful power of the nephalem, so the Angiris Council once launched a vote to discuss whether to genocide the nephalem, right?\"","\"I noticed that the human history of Sanctuary has many records for your High Heaven. if I remember correctly, you Archangel of Justice Tyrael, and your brother Archangel Imperius, Archangel of Hope - Auriel, Archangel of Destiny - Itherael, and Archangel of Wisdom - Malthael your five archangels formed a council of angels called Angus, which ruled the entire High Heaven and continued to fight against demons.\"","\"In that historical record, it seems that the vote was initiated by Imperius, he voted in favor, Auriel opposed, Itherael was neutral, Malthael gave up, and both neutrality and abandonment were considered invalid, So the situation at the time was one-to-one, if you also chose to be neutral or give up at the time, Imperius could use the power of the leader to force this proposal through, right?\"","\"It is precisely because of your vote that it played a key role, so I can see from the texts recorded in human history that they did not feel much about Auriel, who also voted against it at the time. I am very grateful to you, Tyrael! It is precisely because of this matter that your popularity among humans in Sanctuary has reached its peak.\"","\"It's not just me, humans are equally grateful to Auriel!\" Tyrael quickly defended.","\"My disappearance?\" Tyrael's soul pondered for a while, and then said \"Do you want to go to war with High Heaven?\"","\"That said, only your Angiris Council is allowed to execute genocide against the Nephalems, but are we not allowed to win over the Nephalems?\" Roy snorted \"Your double standards are too serious. right?\"","\"That's right, so I voted against it at the time...\" Tyrael said in a low voice.","\"That's right, what's wrong with that?\" Tyrael asked aloud.","\"They will think that in the entire High Heaven, only you care about the life and death of human beings. As for the other archangels, they are either indifferent to human beings, or they are hostile to human beings... Don't doubt, that's what they think!\"","\"Yes, in my opinion, you are the most important link between humans and angels!\" Roy nodded and said, \"The reason why Mephisto Diablo and the others have failed one after another in this world is not because They can't beat your angels, but because they can't beat the combined army of your angels and humans!\"","\"You are a demon, what else can you do if you don't want to fight with angels?\" Tyrael asked rhetorically.","\"You...!\" Tyrael was horrified by Roy's words and wanted to scold him loudly, but he stopped because he knew that what Roy said was the truth!","As long as you meet Tyrael, everything will be easy. Roy also guessed that the angels may be difficult to kill, so he specially created an item with similar functions to the dark soul stone, that is, his hand this crystal stone.","Because Roy's Kanai's box needs souls as fuel for alchemy, Roy judged that after the people of the Horadrim Church figured out the ability of this thing, it is likely to be sealed up. They dare not use this thing.","Besides, when did Roy say that he was going to destroy the world and destroy mankind? Tyrael is suffering from paranoia, right?","Facts have proved that this is the case. The nephalems in this world have great power, but as an archangel of High Heaven, Tyrael has not yet reached the point where he takes a vote of nephalem as his guards wherever he goes. The dignity of an angel would not allow him to do so.","He sat down on the Frozen Throne with satisfaction, and gently tossed the crystal stone that sealed Tyrael's soul in his hand. Seriously, he didn't even expect it to go so smoothly.","He suddenly realized what Roy was trying to convey...","Hearing Roy mention this, Tyrael's swimming soul stopped abruptly!","Holding the crystal stone, Roy shook it vigorously, and said to the golden streamer in the crystal stone \"Tyrael, don't pretend to be dead, I know your consciousness is still there, and you can speak. Don't you want to say something?\"","If the attitude of the entire High Heaven towards the Nephalems is the same as Tyrael, then Tyrael does not have to worry about his disappearance at all, but the problem is here, his brother Imperius, are very hostile!","In any case, in Roy's plan, the first step has been completed perfectly, and the next step can be continued.","In contemplating this, Roy pondered the rationale behind Mephisto and his cohorts. Perhaps, in the midst of the eternal conflict, their perspectives had become entrenched. Humans had managed to employ fragments of the Dark Soul Stone to seal the Seven Demon Kings. So, could it not be possible for the Demon Kings to obtain fragments of the World Stone and fashion a Soul Stone capable of imprisoning the High Angels?","In fact, in Roy's opinion, whether it is an angel or a demon, it is not a good bird. Needless to say, the demon is just because they have the special effect of the Holy Light, so they confuse the human being. There is also the saying that the angel blows the trumpet to destroy the world, and it also destroys the world. What is the difference between the two?","On the fake Kanai's box, Roy left a space-time beacon, and this space-time beacon can be perceived by Roy in general direction, so that there is no need to worry about losing things.","Perhaps people in this world have long been accustomed to the fact that demons and demon kings are sealed. In their thinking, they never imagined that a demon would appear one day, and in turn would seal the soul of their archangel.","Raising his hand, Roy used the power of frost to instantly condense a high platform of ice crystals, and placed the crystal stone on the platform. What kind of special role does it play in Sanctuary!","Roy clenched his paw \"And what I'm doing now is to break your bond!\"","Roy ignored Tyrael's shout and sat back on the throne to think.","Roy said in surprise \"Huh? How did you think of this step?\"","Roy shook his head and said, \"You may think that I imprisoned your soul in order to reduce the battle power of an archangel from the High Heaven, so that I can take the demon army to level the High Heaven, right? Wrong? Now, you're thinking in the wrong direction!\"","Roy was 80-90% sure that this thing would fall into the hands of the New Horadrim Church, so he created a unique octopus demon and used it as a courier to 'send' the fake Kanai's box. Go out, the recipient is the New Horadrim Church.","Roy's Kanai's box is indeed a fake to this world, but don't forget, this is something created by Roy who invested a lot of soul in the system. It was also used to extract the Mobius Mark. It is said that this thing is an ultimate alchemy creation.","Such a creation shouldn't be too difficult for the Demon King, right? Even if they are not proficient in alchemy...","The Archangel of Destiny Itherael is indifferent to human beings, while Malthael has fallen not long ago, attacking human beings as an angel of death, and wants to purify the half of the demon blood of Nephalem. It can be said that, Now in the entire High Heaven, only Auriel can stop Imperius, but if Imperius does his own thing, then as the leader, he may really bring all the angels to execute the Nephalem. purified...","The current Nephalems are like a double-edged sword. Their unique blood of both angels and demons is destined for them to be used by angels and demons, no matter which side they fall to, the other side. It's all a huge damage!","The fact that the dark soul stone has been destroyed is beyond Roy's expectations. Mephisto and the seven demon kings have actually escaped. If they were not wrong, their souls may have already been in the abyss oven. Reborn, but this guy Mephisto pretended to be trapped and found himself from the abyss world, the purpose of which is worth pondering...","Thinking of this, Tyrael was also anxious. His soul was slamming around in the crystal stone, trying to escape. However, he underestimated the crystal stone cage made by Roy. His soul was tossing a little.","This is nothing more than a process of your prejudging me and my prejudging, but Tyrael may never have thought that Roy's real purpose in making such a turn is just to create an opportunity to meet Tyrael.","This kind of meeting, in Roy's estimation, would not have too many people with Tyrael, maybe even Tyrael alone.","This time, Roy's goal is to go to Tyrael. He is very clear that once the power of the fake Kanai's box appears in the world of Sanctuary, it will definitely attract the attention of many people, and they will find this Even if the item does not use the synthesis formula of the genuine Kanai's box, it can still create a powerful magic item.","What he is doing now is nothing more than making arrangements for a possible future war with the High Heaven... As for whether it will really work, it depends... When Lilith returns!","What's more, there is now a new demon king like Roy in Sanctuary. If he provokes it, the relationship between Nephalem and angels should not deteriorate too quickly...","When the box is sealed, Tyrael will definitely appear. With his cautious personality, he should be able to guess that there is something wrong with this box of unknown origin, so he will pay attention to it, and may even set some kind of trap to let it go. The demon behind the box appeared.","With Archangel Tyrael's soul, Roy returned to his Cave."]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["Name Changes","Luo Yin -> Roy","Tyrael -> Tyrael","Aurel -> Auriel","Irithel, Yinceril -> Itherael","Martha Yiner -> Malthael","Impris -> Imperius","Angus Council -> Angiris Council"]}],[{"i":"513---variety","l":"513 - Variety","p":["A year passed quickly. During this year, Roy's Demon King's Palace was also completed and the snowmen and ice demon tribes within a radius of nearly 500 kilometers were all under his control. However, these monsters were restrained by Roy and stayed in the mountains. Only those humans who recklessly entered the snow-capped mountains would be expelled and killed by them, even the people of Xiansai felt a little surprised. Days seem to be more stable than before.","After thinking about it for a while, Roy decided to try his best to subdue the powerful demons and monsters from all over the world. By restraining these guys, he would restrain more low-level monsters and prevent them from invading human territory for the time being.","Although there have been disputes in the past, Tyrael is Imperius' brother after all. In the long eternal battle, Tyrael has always fought side by side with Imperius. Such friendship cannot be erased by disputes...","And, it will get bigger and bigger...","As long as you don't hide in the purgatory space of the flame hell, then in the world of Sanctuary, Roy's whereabouts will be discovered sooner or later. After all, the High Heaven has lost an archangel and this archangel It is not as degenerate as Malthael, so it is certain that after finding out that Roy did not perish with Tyrael, the High Heaven will definitely take revenge on Roy.","At this inquiry, the people of the Horadrim Church could only tell the truth and told their guesses to the messenger of the High Heaven, saying that Tyrael may have perished with the Demon King Osiris.","Because it is separated by a wide strait, Xiansai Island can be said to be inaccessible, but this does not mean that there are no people on the land of this island. In fact, when flying over Xiansai Island from a high altitude before, Roy discovered that Near the southern coast, there is a city where people gather.","But the toughness of the angels aroused the unhappiness of the Nephalem warriors. When Diablo came back from the Dark Soul Stone and gathered the power of the Seven Demon Kings to lead the demon army into the High Heaven, the High Heaven was fundamentally unhappy. Unable to resist, it was Tyrael who brought these Nephalem warriors to help High Heaven defeat Diablo.","But... in the human history of Sanctuary, there has never been a lack of such a power struggle. This is the nature of human beings, even Tyrael can't understand it.","Deep in the mountains, there are a large number of groups of snowmen and ice demons. When Roy's power was released, these monsters with weak demon blood began to move closer to Roy's location. It didn't take long for Roy to gather thousands of troops under his command.","During this period, high-ranking celestial messengers were dispatched to inquire about Tyrael's whereabouts. Concern arose as Tyrael had not returned to the High Heavens for the customary debriefing, and his soul had not been reborn within the Crystal Arch. News of his whereabouts had been lost for an extended period of time.","Even so, those monsters with demon bloodline still have the class inheritance engraved in their bones. As long as Roy is summoned as a demon king, they will soon gather and become part of Roy's demon army.","Given Roy's current position as a demon king, amassing an army of demons requires minimal effort. Thanks to Mephisto and the other six demon kings of Diablo, regions far removed from human civilization within the vast world of Sanctuary are teeming with demons, monsters, undead, fallen beings, and other creatures. These entities, lacking a unified authority, roam aimlessly across the wilderness, forming diverse communities and factions. Engaged in constant battles for territory, they vie for dominance and often resort to cannibalizing their adversaries.","However, Imperius did not consider this possibility either. He maintained a constant vigilance and harbored deep distrust towards the nephalem. From the outset, he sought to eradicate these sanctuaries, leading the High Heavens to cease establishing any liaison offices in the mortal world. Previously, Tyrael served as a means to convey information, but with his absence, the Horadrim Church has lost the ability to contact the High Heavens.","Imperiusoning Tyrael is equivalent to letting him fall. For a long time to come, Tyrael will no longer be able to interfere with the human world in Sanctuary and what Roy has to do is to wait.","In other words, this place is an important source of students for the profession of world mage in Sanctuary...","In spite of his prejudice, Imperius could not help but turn his anger on humans. He ordered the Horadrim Church to find out Tyrael's whereabouts at all costs. Come, then don't blame High Heaven for being rude to them!","In the course of this year, the consequences of Tyrael's disappearance have gradually spread.","In this case, a powerful army of demons is essential for Roy. He is even thinking about whether to summon Julia, Beniam, and the others to this world to manage the army for him.","It is a pity that the elite Nephalem warriors with powerful power in the Horadrim Church are not the management. This has to be said to be a mistake by Tyrael. These warriors are usually only responsible for combat. They rarely interfere in internal affairs, which leads to the fact that in the case of internal chaos, they can't speak at all, and no one wants to listen to their opinions.","Of course, it is still relatively early for the war and Roy does not need too many troops. If there are too many, it will be difficult to support them unless a war is launched against the human beings in the Sanctuary to plunder their souls, but this has nothing to do with Roy's plan. Once the demon attacks humans, it will make them closer to the angels.","Of course, waiting does not mean that Roy does nothing. In fact, after considering several follow-up developments after Tyrael's disappearance, Roy thinks that he needs an army, a huge army of demons, in order to use Deal with a possible attack from the High Heavens.","People who have not awakened the power of the bloodline are no different from ordinary human civilians, but if the Nephalem bloodline is awakened, the people here have a strong affinity for the elements. Although they are isolated from the world, in their historical records, for every a few years, people from the outside Sanctuary will come to select those gifted children to go back to accept the inheritance of the mage.","Roy is also a demon king with status now and he still needs to have some pomp...","Roy was curious to observe the city through the invisible eyes of the demon, and he found that apart from their appearance, the people here were no different from those in other places in Sanctuary, and they were all from the blood of Nephalem.","Roy's location is in the mountains further north of Xiansai Island, and it is quite far away from this human city. Due to the cold climate in the north, the people in Zhoucheng did not explore the mountains. It means that it can be said that he has nothing to do with Roy for the time being and Roy himself does not want to break this balance for the time being.","So, the crack was created at this moment...","The contradiction between humans and angels can only be manifested without the invasion of demons, so what Roy has to do is to try to maintain the current peaceful situation in the entire Sanctuary.","The disappearance of Tyrael will take time to ferment and the relationship between Nephalem and the angel will not deteriorate immediately. To achieve Roy's ideal In that state, he also needs enough patience.","The Horadrim Church, accustomed to Tyrael's gentle demeanor, found such a demanding order highly unsettling. Taking their feelings to the side, they could only strive to fulfill it to the best of their abilities.","The New Horadrim Church was originally founded by Tyrael. After losing Tyrael as a leader, the New Horadrim Church was in a state of leaderless. They began to argue internally about what the Church should do next. Incessantly, some people do not believe that Archangel Tyrael is really dead, so they suggest looking for Tyrael's whereabouts, while others suggest expanding the power of the church to prevent the comeback of the Seven demons, and some people think that they should contact the High Heaven as soon as possible. In short, the internal opinions are chaotic.","The strange thing is that the architectural style of this human city is very oriental. The people living here also look like oriental people with black hair, and the name of this city is actually called \"Zhoucheng\"!","The top leaders of the church did not take into account the feelings of these warriors, so as time passed, these warriors gradually became a little disheartened. They would rather fight the demon to the death than get involved in this kind of power struggle.","The whereabouts of his brother are unknown, but these mortals have only reported the news until now. This can no longer be described as a missed opportunity...","The Xiansai people knew nothing about the lively scene deep in the mountains, and they continued their lives, which could be regarded as covering for Roy's whereabouts.","Therefore, Roy's first step was to gather the monsters around the Xiansai Island where he was.","These tall snowmen and ice demons have enormous power. Under Roy's order, they worked hard and began to build the demon's Palace for Roy.","Tyrael's soul was Imperiusoned in the crystal stone by Roy. Unless Tyrael's soul power can surpass that of Roy, he will not be able to break through in a short time.","When Imperius was beaten to death by Diablo and now he is still commanding the Nephalem warriors with such a tough attitude, of course they will be unhappy in their hearts.","When this news was passed back to the High Heaven and was known by Imperius, the archangel was furious!","Xiansai is a huge island.

There are many worlds, and although these giants are also called Titans, their power is nothing compared to the real Titans.\"","\"How do you say?\" Hearing this, Roy's heart suddenly moved, and he hurriedly continued to ask.","\"I can see some, but I can't see the causal connection before and after! Otherwise, how could my brother and I suffer such a big loss in this world?\" Mephisto admitted bluntly \"It's the same this time. I saw Lilith's return from a future clip.\"","\"I understand!\" Roy nodded and the exchange with Mephisto made him realize that although he needs to be alert to the existence of Trag'Oul, he doesn't need to imagine her too much. She is the only one in the material world. The spokesperson is only the necromancer family. Maybe she will disrupt the situation, but it is estimated that it will not cause too much trouble.","\"In fact, you may not understand that the word Star Soul Titan was originally named by demons!\" Mephisto continued \"Because of their nature, demons are more willing to explore the world than angels. Random teleportation, in some unknown worlds, the demons are often the first to arrive, and the angels are the ones chasing the demons! It gave birth to a powerful planetary consciousness. When these planetary consciousnesses wake up, they often turn into giant and tyrannical beings, so they are called Star Soul Titans. These Star Soul Titans seem to be created by the Creator except angels and demons. The third son of creation, they are the real Titans, they have even more power than angels and demons, so ordinary demons rarely provoke them...\"","\"Like? So, you are not sure?\" Roy asked.","\"Linarian believed him and no longer recognized himself as the son of Inarius and Lilith, he even changed his name and called himself Rathma... But it is ridiculous that, because of the power of practising death, Rathma and his followers all turned pale, and the Necromancers became very different from the other Nephalems. They could not live among ordinary people, because the other Nephalems always looked at them with distrust. They! Their way of balance is only spread in a small area.\"","\"Of course!\" Mephisto gave a strange smile and bowed slightly to Roy \"Young Demon King Osiris, the one in front of you now is one of the oldest demons in the abyss world. My experience, It's wider than you think.\"","\"Oh? Why do you say that?\" Roy asked.","\"Sanctuary will give birth to a star-soul titan, which we did not expect at all!\" Mephisto said with a sigh \"This is obviously just a man-made world and the history of existence is also very short, but there is a Star Soul Titan, this is unexpected! So at the beginning, we didn't think about this aspect, but after our observation, we found that this guy really exists like Star Soul Titan!\"","\"So you don't have to worry too much about her, this guy is a magic stick!\" Mephisto sneered \"She is full of rhetoric about guarding the balance, including those necromancers who believe in her, who believe in guarding the balance. , but in my opinion, this teaching is not only a rhetoric of Trag'Oul's own existence, but also a manifestation of her guilty conscience, because both angels and demons have the idea of ​​destroying Sanctuary, and Sanctuary is her, once destroyed, it means that Trag'Oul can no longer survive...\"","\"That's absolutely, she wiped out all the demons in the entire Sanctuary!\" Mephisto said with certainty \"So it's hard to guarantee that after her return this time, she will also take action against demons like us. You know, this Women don't have any concept of race!\"","\"That's it!\" Mephisto also nodded in agreement \"In order to achieve her goal, this guy will do whatever it takes. She used the son of Inarius and Lilith, Linarian! That is the first generation, or The first nephalem in Sanctuary! Jie Jie Jie, this poor child, he had a terrible relationship with his parents because his mother Lilith slaughtered the renegade angels and demons just to force Inarius to give up The idea of ​​domination over the human race allows her to use the power of the Nephalem as a weapon for her own benefit.\"","\"That's right, compared to Trag'Oul, I think what you really need to worry about is Lilith!\" Mephisto said with a cautious look \"This is the second thing I want to say, from the long river of time, I have seen some fragmented fragments of the future, and in these fragments, Lilith has returned!\"","\"That's true, so Osiris, this is also a breakthrough!\" Mephisto smiled strangely \"If it is possible, I really want to see necromancers and their compatriots fight in fighting. although they always fight infighting, but the Necromancer is a believer of Trag'Oul. Once this heritage declines, Trag'Oul's existence will be even more unknown.\"","\"The true awakening of the Star-Soul Titan will manifest a tangible form in the material word!\" Mephisto exclaimed. \"In the Book of Rathma, the necromancers' depictions of Trag'Oul, in my estimation, lack the telltale signs of complete awakening. Otherwise, she would not be described as a 'dragon composed of stars.' It is my belief that she remains in an ethereal state, hindered by inherent deficiencies within her star-soul nature. Her slumber has been too brief, and as a star-soul titan, she faces inherent limitations... I suspect this is the true reason why she cannot reveal herself to the world—it is not that she lacks the desire, but rather, she lacks the capability!\"","\"Understood, so she keeps promoting the concept of balance, just to keep the eternal battle between angels and demons going!\" Roy nodded \"If she fights for tens of thousands of years, she will be able to escape from the Sanctuary. This planet has completely grown up, then she will be afraid of no one.\"","\"Wait, wait!\" Roy waved his hand and said, \"Among the many legends in this world, isn't it said that Lilith is your daughter? Are you a father, are you still afraid of your daughter?\"","\"Well, indeed, it sounds like she is also deliberately avoiding angels and demons!\" Roy nodded in agreement \"You can also see some clues from her desperate attempts to hide the Sanctuary.\"","\"When Linarian was at a loss, Trag'Oul found him, the professor gave him the knowledge of death, made Linarian the first necromancer in this world, and bewitched him that the Nephalem should be independent You can do it by living your life without depending on angels or demons, just by believing in the way of balance.\"","\"Who knows?\" Mephisto spread his hands and said \"She is always mysterious, how can I know what she wants? Originally after she and Inarius married and gave birth to Nephalem, Me and My brother always thought that her experiment was to create a mixed race of angels and demons. After all, she is a female demon and has the need to breed offspring. Although this need is a bit different, it is not too bizarre, but later we found that even if Nephalem, not what she really wanted.\"","\"Yes, Trag'Oul, she is hiding in a gap between Sanctuary and Purgatory. This gap seems to have been created by her. Unless she wants to, no one can get there. Then Over the years, she has rarely appeared in the world, and she has been hiding very well!\" Mephisto said with some hatred \"This guy claims to be the guardian of the Sanctuary, when Inarius and Lilith created the In the world of Sanctuary, the Sanctuary was hidden from the High Heaven and the Hell of Flames. After Lilith and Inarius turned against each other and were exiled, Sanctuary was almost exposed to heaven and hell, but Trag'Oul actually took action at this time, wrapped her body around the world of Sanctuary, and continued to hide it! So much so that by the time we discovered the existence of Sanctuary, the world had existed for a long time...\"","\"You asked me to be careful of her because she would attack angels and demons when she came back?\" Roy asked with a frown.","\"You think you can deceive me? It won't be so simple!\" Roy sneered. Mephisto may be unaware that Roy is in a different world, but Roy has encountered other avatar of Lilith. There exists a peculiar connection, an inexplicable bond between Roy and Lilith that Mephisto cannot fathom!","After finishing speaking, Mephisto also explained: \"At the beginning, I just brought Lilith to this world and what I brought was only a clone of her. She came to this world and asked for it, because she need a test site\"","As a demon who has been in contact with the power of the void several times, Roy does not believe that Lilith will return safe and sound after being exiled to the void...","As a result, Mephisto's ugly monster's face showed a white-eyed look, and said \"Damn Osiris, how can you believe these legends of human beings? Who told you that Lilith is my daughter? I didn't. With such a great ability, how can i be Lilith's father! In other words, apart from the Creator, no one dares to be Lilith's elder!\"","As far as Roy knows, Lilith has clones in many worlds, and these clones are doing the same thing, at least in the Darksiders World, the Lilith that Roy met is the same, but in the Darksiders World, she The experiment was done with the corpses of angels and demons (here can be regarded as genetic experiments), and did not choose to have children with an angel, so the Nephilim (Nephalem) in the Darksiders World just regarded Lilith as a nominal mother.","As he spoke, Mephisto's figure slowly sank down, and finally completely disappeared in the hall.","But then Roy reacted and asked suspiciously, \"Mephisto, do you also know the 'Star Soul Titan'?\"","Connecting with the original sin demon kings who are also in the abyss world, Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Baal, they all seem to only have a few scattered clones left, and the real body has already disappeared, so Has their body also gone to the depths of the void as Roy had guessed?","He either wanted Roy to resolve this disaster that might involve the Seven Demon Kings, or he wanted Roy to be a shield! You must know that the seven demon kings are now hidden in the Burning Hell, and there is only a demon king like Roy in the sheltered land. After Lilith returns, she will definitely vent her anger from being exiled for many years. Whether it is an angel or a demon, she is the target of venting. And Roy, the only demon king on the earth, is the best shield of the flaming hell!","Hearing this, Roy never spoke, but he had already made a judgment in his heart.","Hearing this, Roy suddenly thought about it, thinking of Urgash and Asha in the Ashan world. These two dragon gods are dragons that are huge enough to entangle the entire planet, so are they also star soul titans? After all, they all have the power to create the world, which is very similar to the Star Soul Titan.","Her avatar, like the original Urgash, may have been eroded by the power of the void!","If it is, then the world of Ashan is really special. Asha and Urgash are like two star-soul titans born on the same planet at the same time. They belong to the twins of the star-soul titan... Pantheon is ecstatic.","If Lilith's avatar and her avatar share memory and thinking like Mephisto, then Lilith, who has returned, will understand immediately after seeing Roy.","If this Trag'Oul, which Mephisto calls the Star Soul Titan, is really a Titan on the same level as Sargeras, then it will be really troublesome.","In other words, Lilith's experiment in this world failed.","It's a pity that Roy is only guessing now. Urgash has become the lord of the void, and the world of Asha has been completely swallowed up by the power of the void. It is already impossible to study everything in that world.","Looking at Roy's appearance, Mephisto thought he was worried that the power of the Star Soul Titan would hinder him, so he said \"But you don't have to care too much about Trag'Oul existence. Although the Ona guy may be a star soul titan, he doesn't seem to wake up completely!\"","Looking back, Roy asked Mephisto \"Can you see the future fragments from the long river of time?\"","Mephisto concluded \"No matter what the reason is, it can be said that the Nephalem is not what Lilith really wants. The real purpose of her coming to this world is probably more than that. This mysterious woman It hides a secret that even we can't see through...\"","Mephisto is afraid of Lilith, otherwise he will not let Roy be careful of Lilith. That is to say, he not only sees Lilith's return in future clips, but also may see Lilith's powerful power. Take a bold guess, Mephisto even saw the picture of himself dying at the hands of Lilith!","Mephisto, the bastard, said nine points of truth and one point of falsehood. Roy was sure that what he said before about Trag'Oul and Lilith's return was true, but he concealed one thing, that's the power after Lilith's return!","Of course, Roy's current appearance has already changed, but it doesn't matter, the egg of the Red Sea he brought is the biggest token!","Or, because of the lack of power to fight against the void, it has already fallen into it? So Lilith has to learn their lessons and find a way to fight the void?","Perhaps it is because of this that Lilith becomes unstoppable, and Mephisto may have seen Roy's figure in the future clips. This is how he really came forward and invited Roy to come to this sanctuary. The real reason for the world!","Roy had a clear understanding in his heart and he roughly guessed Lilith's real purpose. What she needed was a powerful force, which was enough for her to deal with the threat of void erosion.","Roy nodded. This is true. When he was still in the abyss world, Benia once told Roy that Mephisto should be the first big devil to appear after Lucifer and the other seven original sin devils. In other words, his existence history is second only to Lucifer Beelzebub and them.","Roy took over the conversation and said, \"Unfortunately, because of the existence of demons, although the Nephalem people hate these necromancers, they still accept necromancers in order to fight against demons, don't they?\"","Roy watched him leave the whole time. After Mephisto's figure completely disappeared, Roy grabbed the demon's claw in his right hand. Under the powerful force, the air made a huge explosion in his palm. Roy's entire complexion completely collapsed.","Roy's thinking was a little messed up, so he quickly drove out these inexplicable thoughts. No matter whether his guess was correct or not, these thoughts interfered too much with him.","So Roy has another bold guess: Lilith, she may want to go to the depths of the void to find something...","So the Nephalem might just be an attempt by her, which can also explain why Lilith loved the Nephalem more at the beginning, because she had expectations for the Nephalem, but maybe it was later that she found out about the Nephalem. After Nephalem can't bear her expectation, she will gradually become only wanting to use the power of Nephalem, which is a kind of psychological transformation from \"own child\" to \"tool person\".","So, what does she want to do to fight against the erosion of the void? It can't be to save the world, right?","The boundless darkness filled the entire Demon King's Palace, Roy's power was exuding recklessly. In this lightless world, only his pair of bright red eye were left, shining a strong light in the darkness...","The simple mixture of light and darkness is not the power of chaos. This is something that Roy can be absolutely sure of, but he made a judgment based on his own experience and many cognition. For Lilith, who can only explore step by step from scratch. As far as the concerned, she must not know.","To be honest, Roy was really taken aback when he heard Mephisto mention the word 'Star Soul Titan'.Because the first character that popped up in his mind was Sargeras.","What Lilith is after may indeed not be Nephalem, who is a hybrid of angels and demons, but is searching for the power of chaos!","Yes, this is where Roy finds it strange. After all, the name Star Soul Titan should be called by the world of Azeroth, and other worlds should not be called this way. Is Mephisto going? Been to the world of Azeroth?"]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["Name changes","Linarion -> Linarian","Former name of Rathma","World of dark blood -> Darksiders World","Not sure about Wanjie, but there is a show \"Wan Jie Shen Zhu\", not sure though"]}],[{"i":"516---the-first-war-against-angels-led-by-roy","l":"516 - The First War Against Angels Led by Roy","p":["After all, the world of Sanctuary was created with the Worldstone as the cornerstone.

Maybe Lilith will become a Void Lord at the moment of her return, so it will be a big game.","After the High Heaven found out, things were completely out of control, and the High Heaven could no longer tell who was behind the scenes.","After the survival rights of mortals were ensured, the Angiris Council and the lords of the Burning Hell reached a ceasefire agreement, and both agreed that the power of the Burning Hell and the High Heaven would not interfere with the mortal world. Human beings could decide their own destiny, as this agreement In one of the terms, Inarius was handed over to the demons, who tortured him for eternity.","After the war, the Angiris Council negotiated with Mephisto to decide the fate of the mortal world, and on the question of whether to forgive mortals at the council, Tyrael would cast the crucial vote against, allowing Sanctuary The world survives.","After thinking about it, Imperius also rejected Auriel's proposal. He believes that the war with the demon is the responsibility of the angel. Even if it is out of balance with the power of hell, don't you even have the courage to fight?","Although Mephisto's warning is mixed, Roy believes that Lilith's return should be true. Through his historical interpretation of this world, Roy estimated that Lilith in this world is afraid of being caught. Exiled into the void for thousands of years!","Although the Worldstone was destroyed in the last war, there has been a special rhetoric among the wise men in the Sanctuary world recently.","Among the mortals, there is only one person who still remembers this war, remembers Uldyssian, that is the one who left his hometown with Uldyssian, his brother Mendeln... But Mendeln was not in the attention of angels and demons at that time.","Archangel like Tyrael, what he sees is the greatness of human courage and self-sacrifice, while what Imperius sees is human selfishness and cruelty to his fellow man, as for Malthael is as indifferent as looking at ants...","As a place for spreading faith, churches can be said to be huge in the world of Sanctuary, so of course it is impossible for every church to have angels in charge. It is always human beings who manage churches, and as human beings, it is also very harmful for priests to appear privately. It's normal, but it's bad that this kind of thing happens in such a period.","As a result, the Nephalem people began to resist the High Heaven. Now they have powerful powers, they can also suppress the army of angels in turn. They began to gain pleasure from beheading these angels who used to symbolize light...","As far as Roy knows at present, among the items related to the legacy of the creator, one is the demon's Bible stone tablet left in the abyss world, the other is the true book of heaven, and the other is Lilith's Red Sea Egg (suspected). The creator-like relics contain some kind of magical power, which are the traces and imprints left by the creator when he created thousands of worlds.","As for Roy himself, he is silently accumulating the power of the demon. He has now completely become the spokesperson of the flaming hell. During the period when the Seven demons have not returned, he is the supreme leader of the entire flaming hell. The army of millions of demons is ready to go, just waiting for Roy's order, they will completely destroy the entire High Heaven under the leadership of Roy, kill all the angels, and completely end the eternity of this world. battle.","As for the Book of Truth, maybe when you enter the High Heaven, you will be able to see it...","As for why the entanglement is involved, it involves a mystery of Sanctuary. About three thousand years ago, when the world of Sanctuary was just discovered by heaven and hell, Lilith had already been discovered by heaven and hell. Inarius was banished to the Void, and both Heaven and Hell recklessly developed religion in the world of Sanctuary, hoping to develop power through the lever of Sanctuary in order to overwhelm each other.","As the leader of the Angiris Council, Imperius felt an unprecedented and urgent threat. Of course, he also knew that after the death of Malthael, the souls of Diablo and the other seven demon kings returned to the Hell of Flames. In a few years, or even decades, the Seven Demon Kings will make a comeback after regaining their strength.","At that time, the humans in Sanctuary were weak and helpless. They were pawns that angels and demons could play with at will. Even Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice, had the same attitude towards humans in Sanctuary as Imperius. , Heaven created the Holy Light Church in Sanctuary, and Hell also created Tritheism in Sanctuary. Heaven and Hell spread their beliefs while borrowing these two churches to fight proxy wars in Sanctuary.","At the end of the war, Uldyssian realized that the more powerful he used, the faster his loss of humanity would accelerate, but for the future of mankind, he resolutely decided to sacrifice himself, unleashing all the power of Nephalem, and destroying the angels. Banish all the demons from Sanctuary.","Auriel could only sigh about Imperius's decision. She also knew the potential meaning of Imperius's words. Now that the situation is unclear, how could Imperius be so cowardly to seek mortals? help? Where does the pride of an angel go?","But under such circumstances, Lilith, who was unwilling to fail after being exiled to the Void, became a spoiler. She did not know how to escape the Void—probably because when she was first exiled, she was only exiled to the Void. On the fringes of the material world—she's back once in a while.","Due to Roy's decision to hide behind the scenes, the mortals in Sanctuary have not suffered from demons for a long time.","During the upcoming meeting, I wish that Archangel Auriel addresses this issue as well. As the only female angel within the High Heavens, Auriel holds a favorable view of the denizens of Sanctuary. She earnestly desires Imperius to alter his view, releasing his prejudice against humanity. Auriel advocates for the widespread dissemination of the doctrine of light, aiming to harness the potential of the Nephalem's power in future conflicts against the demonic hordes of Hell.","Everyone has the hope of awakening their bloodline and becoming stronger. After the Worldstone was destroyed, the shackles that imprisoned human beings disappeared, so naturally, the idea of ​​​​groups began to rise, and many people began to believe that human beings should control their own destiny.","Everyone knows that the so-called proxy war is very cruel to the proxy, because in the end all human beings die, and the angels and demons are not damaged at all...","For the humans in the Sanctuary, most of the time, they are on the side of the High Heaven.","For this argument, Roy believes that it is credible, because it is impossible to imagine that a Worldstone with a diameter of only one or two meters can be used as a cornerstone to create a world the size of a planet, so Roy also believes that it should be There is an even larger Worldstone body.","For thousands of years, the belief in the Holy Light has been the mainstream of the world of Sanctuary. Although there are ancestral beliefs such as barbarians, elemental beliefs of mages, and even balance beliefs of necromancers, these beliefs cannot be regarded as mainstream.","He sent angels to put down these rebellions!","High Heaven has been silently observing the humans in the Sanctuary, and has always been troubled by their capriciousness. Several archangels of the Angiris Council have different personalities, so they naturally observe humans from an angle. Also different.","However, over the years, there have been many wise men in Sanctuary. When they continue to study and explore the relationship between angels and demons, they find that angels are not good people. The existence of the world of Sanctuary is a mistake. Whether it's a demon or an angel, they all deliberately want to destroy this place, but compared to the tyrannical demon, the angel is just a little gentler.","Imperius doesn't know this? Of course he knows! When Diablo entered the High Heaven, he also saw how powerful the nephalems who started to regain their strength, but the problem was that he was quite entangled with these powerful nephalems!","Imperius knew that if these events could not be stopped quickly, the high heavens would completely lose the faith of mortals, but Imperius, who was embarrassed and aged, made a wrong decision on this matter.","Imperius struggled with this. As one of the participants in the original sin war at the time, he was also shocked by the power of Uldyssian. The potential of the Nephalem race was beyond his imagination. So on the one hand, Imperius also hopes to use the power of Nephalem to defend against the demons of hell, on the other hand, he is very worried about the emergence of people like Uldyssian again. Don't fight the demons by then, and the mortals turn their heads and turn the angels again. It would be too embarrassing to be expelled from Sanctuary again.","In just half a year, an astonishing number of churches have been burned down in various countries in the Land of Sanctuary. A large number of church personnel have been turned into prisoners and exiled, and the voice of expelling the Church of the Holy Light has been loud.","In this case, human beings are naturally more willing to accept the teachings of the angels and take the Holy Light as their belief.","In this way, it is a bad dish. Now that the idea of ​​​​groups is on the rise, this kind of thing can easily be spread, and then infinitely magnified. For a time, human beings are excited, and more attacks against churches also appear. And because of the contradiction between theocracy and kingship, countries have also begun to condone such attacks.","In truth, the state of the High Heavens has been far from favorable. Following Malthael's transformation into the Angel of Death, he was eventually vanquished by a group of Nephalem led by Tyrael. Imperius initially presumed that Malthael's demise would lead to his soul being purified and subsequently reborn. However, to the High Heaven's concern, the Crystal Arch failed to recondense Malthael's soul. Imperius, troubled by this turn of events, briefly entertained the notion that Diablo's influence could somehow be connected to Malthael's fate.","Initially, Uldyssian intended to continue his pursuit of expelling Inarius. However, amidst the ongoing war, he stumbled upon the discovery of the Worldstone. Determined to harness its power, Uldyssian used his own abilities to manipulate the frequency of the Worldstone, unleashing the dormant potential of the human Nephalem. This audacious act did not go unnoticed by the High Heavens, leading to an invasion by an army of angels upon Sanctuary. Seizing the opportunity, the Burning Hells also joined the fray, transforming the conflict into a three-way showdown between the forces of Heaven, Hell, and the Nephalem.","It can be said that this is a very special period for human beings. Uldyssian re-seals the power of the Nephalem and it is estimated that such a situation will occur, but humans have no memory of the original sin war. In this case, no one can raise the alarm, and people think that this is the best time for Sanctuary.","It has to be said that Roy's arrival was chosen at a very good time. After losing the threat of demons, and the Zakarum followers he sent out lurking in the crowd to continue bewitching, human beings are very interested in The disgust of the Holy Light Church began to rise sharply, and the demon gold circulating in the human world was also constantly amplifying the ambitions of human beings.","It's just that they didn't know that this decision completely ruined the chance for High-Order Heaven to finally win over the Nephalem...","Lilith found a Nephalem named Uldyssian. Uldyssian was originally just a poor peasant, but he was framed and persecuted by the Holy Light Church and the Trinity Church, who were preaching in Sanctuary at that time, and had to be forced to. Taking his brother and relatives away from home, Lilith found Uldyssian. She knew that Uldyssian had a powerful Nephalem bloodline, so after constantly approaching Uldyssian, she helped him liberate the powerful bloodline. Power, Lilith hoped that Uldyssian could use this power to expel Inarius and all the angels and demons.","Moreover, in the eternal war, the war between angels and demons is also to a large extent competing with each other for the Worldstone. If this thing is really so fragile, I am afraid that it has been destroyed in tens of thousands of years of war, where is it? Possibly kept for so long?","Of course, after every demonic invasion, these humans will soon unite to resist the demons.","Of course, this is just the idea of ​​the demons, but they don't know what Roy is really thinking. With so many troops, Roy is not only guarding against High Heaven, but more is actually guarding against Lilith...","Ordinary angels have always been disgusted by the Nephalems who already have demon blood, so the suppressed angel troops naturally caused huge casualties in Sanctuary, which intensified the conflict.","Roy doesn't know what these things are for, but since he has come into contact with them, he will naturally collect them subconsciously. He has collected several pieces of the demon's Bible Stone Tablet, and they are all placed in his portable space. The Egg of the Red Sea also in his hands.","Simultaneously, Uldyssian harbored concerns that other Nephalem would suffer the loss of their humanity, similar to his own experience following the explosive surge of power. To prevent this, he made the decision to reintegrate the power back into his own body. Ultimately, this choice led to his demise, and in the process, the power within him ceased to exist. The frequency of the Worldstone was subsequently readjusted, reverting to its original state, and the potency of the Nephalem bloodline once again vanished.","The difference in observation angle naturally determines the different attitudes of the archangels towards human beings.","The estrangement between the High Heaven and the mortal world of the Sanctuary makes them very slow to respond to various information in the mortal world. Just when the angels are still living a long and boring life as always, the situation in the Sanctuary world is not. more and more intense.","The history of this world, because of Roy's appearance, has completely moved to an unknown turning point...","The irritated Imperius didn't stop Auriel's advice at all. Anyway, there was no demon to disturb him. He simply led the army and directly invaded the world of Sanctuary... In this way, Roy came to the fifth place in this world. Year, the war between humans and angels begins!","The mighty Uldyssian, with all the power he unleashes as powerful as a god, illuminates the entire world of Sanctuary...","The Nephalem people realize that even if the shadow of the demon has disappeared, the existence of angels is still a big mountain pressing on their heads. If human beings want to win an independent living space, then whether they are demons or angels, they must be expelled. Object.","The reason is simple, they are often persecuted and harassed by demons! Demons with a destructive and destructive nature are the natural enemies of all living things. When human beings are unable to resist powerful demons, they will naturally fall to the side of angels.","The reason why he is so interested in the Worldstone is because Roy feels that this thing is probably a legacy of the creator!","The rest of the Worldstone, if it is really the last word of the creator... Well, it is really difficult to get hold of this, unless the entire world of Sanctuary is blown up...","The scene of the chaos dragon Urgash being corrupted by the void is still vivid in his mind. At the moment when Urgash escaped from trouble, the entire Ashan world was destroyed. Roy can be said to have a deep memory. At that time, Roy still There is no way to deal with the power of the void, but this time is different. He became the chaotic power mastered by the Demon Queen, which has been proved in the demon May Cry World. That time, Roy used the power of chaos and the power of the void to fight, repair and close it. The gate of the void, if Lilith is really corrupted by the void, then Roy also has the confidence to touch Lilith.","The three remaining archangels are already completely out of balance when dealing with the Seven Demon Kings. If the new Demon King is added, once the war comes again, the High Heaven may really be destroyed.","The wise believe that the body of the Worldstone should be extremely huge, and it is hidden in the core of the planet underfoot!","The Worldstone was destroyed, more and more human beings began to gradually awaken the power of the Nephalem in their blood.

It's impossible to be confident enough in your own strength to deliberately add an archangel-level opponent to yourself, right?","Sure enough, when Tyrael came to the Demon King's Palace, he found that there was no one here, and the Demon King Osiris had long since disappeared, as if he had created conditions for him to escape.","The Archangel Tyrael, who wore the face of Uldyssian, broke out of the Bright Soul Stone and stumbled to the ground.","The Archangel was originally a creature composed of holy light.

With the support of his constant magic, the dark crack finally stabilized and eventually turned into a vortex-like portal.","For thousands of years, the demon army of the abyss of Flames has invaded the High Heaven several times. It was used by the army when the High Heaven invaded abyss. Anyway, during the whole process of the eternal battle, the demons fought the High Heaven, and the angels also fought the flame abyss.","Hearing these words from Itherael, the four archangels could not help but be silent for a while.","Hearing this, Itherael finally spoke. It seemed that because he seldom spoke for a long time, Itherael's voice sounded a little hoarse, and he said \"In my scroll, the fate of mortals in Sanctuary has never appeared, because these mortals are not natural creations, but this text has been displayed on the scroll of fate since this time...\"","Imperius looked at Itherael, who had not spoken, and asked, \"Has your destiny scroll displayed any content?\"","In fact, whether it is Tyrael or Imperius, when they know that the demon army is about to attack the High Heaven, they are not too anxious in their hearts, because they are already familiar with this set of offensive and defensive processes.","In the sea of ​​clouds outside the Diamond Gate, Tyrael put down the Bright Soul Stone and took a few steps back.","Involuntarily, everyone thought of the upcoming Demon King Osiris. Could this 'despair' be him?","It was not until this time that Roy retracted his arms and drilled out of the portal completely. He landed on the ground with a thud, causing the ground to tremble for a while. This action also caused his entire body to squat slightly.","Itherael didn't speak, just raised his hands, and then a huge scroll filled with golden light emerged between his hands, Itherael gently opened his hands, and the golden scroll followed Open slowly.","Justice will fall to the mortal world, which should refer to the incident in which Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice, self-destructed his wings and fell into the Sanctuary to become a human being.","On the page of the scroll, lines of text appeared quietly.","Raising his head, the first thing Roy saw was the huge city in the distance. The golden holy light was like the sun, falling from the gaps in the clouds and shining on the city, making the whole city glow. This beautiful picture, even Roy couldn't help but let out a sigh of praise.","Roy grinned wickedly and said \"Why don't you dare to come? You know, I'm here to chase an angel thief who stole my stuff! Archangel Tyrael, I didn't expect you angels to do this kind of thing\"","The angel army of the entire silver city is being mobilized in an orderly manner, but due to the previous attack on the Sanctuary, there are still many angel troops that have not been transferred back. Tt is not Mephisto who came to attack the silver city this time, neither the seven old-fashioned demon kings, is a strange demon king, making the angels are still a little uncertain about what the other party will do.","The fissure has been expanding, and the light has become more and more dazzling. Tyrael, who has a mortal body, couldn't help covering his eyes with his hands, and then only heard a loud bang, and a circle of light waves centered on the fissure. Suddenly it spread out, and the crack was completely torn apart!","The location he chose is called the Sea of ​​Clouds Plain. Although it is the Sea of ​​Clouds, it is actually the foundation below, which is the extension of the foundation of the entire Silver City. However, due to the particularity of the space where the high-order heaven is located, this piece of land has been tumbling and growing. The clouds and mists are endless throughout the year, so it looks like clouds here.","The owner of the devil's claws is naturally the Demon King Osiris. Tyrael can be sure of this, because he has seen Roy and remembers what Roy's hands look like. He knows that the Demon King Osiris is using his own strength to forcibly tear open this space rift, trying to turn it into a passable portal.","The wing of light behind the Archangel of Courage Imperius looks as red as a flame. This wing of flame is just like Imperius' character, with a fiery temper and high fighting spirit. As for the Archangel Auriel of Hope, the light wings behind her flowed a faint blue, like gentle flowing water. As for the Archangel of Destiny, Itherael, behind him is a light wing filled with a purple halo, just like destiny, mysterious and incomprehensible.","These three golden streams of light were Imperius, and Auriel and Itherael who had arrived after the news. They slowly stood up and walked towards Tyrael.","This passage on the Fate Scroll looks a bit vague at first glance. If it was put decades ago, it would not have understood its meaning at all. After the events fall of the angel of death, the four archangels can find the corresponding mapping from this text.","Tyrael nodded and said \"Yes, if my guess is correct, the trembling of the sphere is that the devil Osiris is trying to contact this sphere, and Osiris will use it as a beacon to open the portal directly enter High Heaven.\"","Tyrael took over the conversation and said, \"So, who is Despair...\"","Under the eyes of the four archangels, he slowly straightened up, and the pair of huge reverse wings behind him also stretched out, and his body was filled with mist, and it appeared to be one body in the clouds and mist of the plain.","When the end comes, wisdom will be lost, And justice will fall to earth Bravery burns into rage— And all hope will be swallowed up by despair At last, death will spread its wings and cover the sun— Fate was torn to shreds forever","Whether it's Imperius, Auriel, or Itherael, what they are shrouded under the visor and hood is just a ray of light, without any face or expression at all, which sets off Tyrael's appearance It's an alternative, but fortunately the angels don't care about it. After coming to stand beside Tyrael, the four archangels all looked at the bright soul stone not far away.","With Roy's strong tearing, the leaked space power began to affect the surrounding environment, and a large number of fine lightnings appeared around the cracks, bursting with strong rays of light.","Without waiting for everyone to understand, suddenly, the bright soul stone placed on the ground stopped shaking and slowly floated in mid-air.

Except for encountering some powerful demon lords, neither Imperius nor Tyrael did much. Most of the time, he is commanding the angel army to fight.","All this happened silently from beginning to end, this figure seemed to have never appeared, only the invisible light film that wrapped Auriel remained...","Although there is a war going on in the High Heaven, Roy is not in a hurry at all. Mephisto and the others have prepared a huge number of demon armies for him in the Hell of Flames. These demon armies cannot be exhausted for a while. More elite demonic creatures have yet to appear.","Archangel like Auriel, even if he is immersed in this void, Roy is not sure how long it will take for the erosion to complete. So this is just a move of Roy's passive action. After leaving Auriel's location, Roy wandered in the void.","As for Itherael, he has already returned to the Destiny Library. He is not very good at fighting himself, so now his task is to use the power of the Destiny Scroll to find a way to find Auriel's location and put his own Bring back the sisters.","At the moment on the battlefield, in addition to the clouds and mist, there are countless gray-black fine particles. These are the last remnants of the demons killed by the angels with the holy light during the war. Under the burning of the holy light, they died. The demon's soul returned to the Hell of Flames, but the corpse turned into these black ashes, which were left on the battlefield, fluttering along with the shock waves caused by the battle, and had filled the entire battlefield.","But now, there is one more such miracle. After confirming that the signal between himself and the Imp was completely stable, Roy immediately started the exchange. He saw a flash of light and Roy's figure disappeared immediately. At Roy's location, a little Imp suddenly appeared. This Imp who fluttered his little wings was trapped in place and couldn't move. After just a few seconds, it was eroded by the power of the void, disappeared completely, and turned into a part of the void.","Empty, silence, nothingness, even if there is an eye of the void that allows Roy to observe the void world, but there is nothing in this world for him to observe, the incomparably huge void world, no matter which direction it flies, it is exactly the same, there is no end, There are no edges.","Enveloped within an imperceptible shimmering aura, Auriel remained unaware of its presence, yet an unexplainable sensation of distinctiveness engulfed her being. Had Roy been present, he would have observed her being encased in this ethereal film of light. Auriel herself experienced a heightened sense of agility, as even the most subtle movements of her body seemed accelerated, causing her radiant wings to leave trailing afterimages with each unconscious flutter.","Flying high in the sky and witnessing the appearance of Roy, Tyrael gasped at this moment, his blood pressure soared and his brain was dizzy, and he almost fell from a height like this...","However, just when Tyrael felt that victory was in sight, a powerful and familiar aura of power suddenly appeared on the battlefield!","However, Tyrael and the others probably would not have thought that Roy could move freely in the void world. You must know that the reason why people who were exiled to the void are difficult to return is largely because they cannot move in the void. They need the help of people on the material world side to \"pull\" them back with external force. To do this, not only do they need to establish a connection between the material world and the void world, but also some special ceremonies are often required. That's right... This is also the reason why they couldn't pull Auriel back immediately. They can only prepare for this matter after the war in the High Heaven is over.","I have to say that Tyrael and Itherael really used a lot of effort to banish Roy into the depths of the void. Sprinting at Roy's current speed, it took a long time to finally return to matter Above the edge of the world.","If you observe carefully, you will find that the power of void erosion has no effect on this figure. The particles around her body that should have been eroded and dissipated are in a strange state of cessation, and some particles are even half dissipated, but the other half still exists.","Imperius is in command, Tyrael is attacking the portal with a part of the army, and wants to close the portal to prevent more demons from entering the High Heaven. Everything is going on in an orderly manner, and the balance of victory is moving towards High Heaven. One side leans.","In the High Heaven, the war outside the Silver City is still going on.","In the pair of huge misty wings behind him, just like breathing lights, some strange-looking lines flickered on and off. This is the automatic appearance after he set the void flight ability for himself. On his foggy wings, these lines seem to be formed by the system itself, which may be called [Void Runes]. When these rune patterns shine, Roy can move freely in the void.","In view of the strange flashing trajectory, it took a lot of time for the figure to come to the area where Roy and Auriel were before. At this time, Roy had already left, and only Auriel was still curled up in the original area. Still focusing on resisting the combined erosion of the void and the curse.","It takes a long time for pure void power erosion to transform a material world individual into a void and the more powerful the individual... the longer it takes.","It was as if the time around her body had been completely stopped...","It wasn't until in the end that she retreated to the position where she first appeared and after it was exactly the same, she closed her eyes again, and the whole figure was once again integrated with the background of the void...","It's just that the movement of this figure is not like Roy, who is flying by the wings of the void, but maintains a rigid posture, flashing abruptly in the void, and the flashing trajectory is also a bit strange, not towards a The direction flashed, but the left and right, the front and the back, the completely incomprehensible trajectory.","Of course, even if someone is nearby at this time, it is impossible to see this scene in the void environment... There is an extremely cold look in the golden eyes, this strange figure silently floats in the void, only stayed in place for a while, and then started to move.","One can imagine how many demons died at the hands of angels during this time.","Opportunities to enter the void world are rare, and naturally, Roy is hesitant to depart prematurely. However, the reality is not shaped by human desires. After aimlessly wandering for over an hour, regret begins to consume Roy's thoughts, as he realizes the stark truth...","Right after the Imp vanished, deep within the void, a sudden flicker of golden eyes emerged. These eyes possessed the distinct slits of a typical demon's gaze, yet their golden hue seemed peculiar.","Roy couldn't find any trace of Lilith and the legendary creature of the void. Roy didn't know if it was not born yet or if it was rare to come across. In short, after wandering around for a while, Roy decided to give up. There is no need to waste time in this empty world.","Roy originally wanted to try to find out if he could find Lilith's trace, but now that he looked at it, this idea was unrealistic, and he couldn't find it at all. It was like looking for a specific water molecule in the huge Pacific Ocean. Same, it's really hard.","Seeing this scene, there was a cruel smile in the cold eyes of the owner of the golden eyes, and then she did not move, the began to flash again. The trajectory of each flash was exactly the same as when she came before, but it's a series of regressed images! like rewinding...","Such a crazy offensive, the effect is naturally there. During the period of Roy's departure, the barrier of the Silver City has been broken due to exhaustion of energy, and the flying demons have already flown into the Silver City and started the destruction. Unfortunately, the ground troops failed to keep up, these flying demons ended up being strangled by angel warriors.","The demon side suffered huge casualties, and the angel side was not far behind. A large number of gray and defeated angel armors were embedded in the earth in various strange postures. These are the relics left by the angels who died in battle. The fallen angel armor has been trampled by thousands of demons at least.","The reason why the ground troops could not keep up was because they were blocked by the Diamond Gate. This incomparably solid gate, together with the equally strong city walls around it, firmly protected the Silver City. The gigantic demons were banging on the city walls and gates with their weapons, but they couldn't leave the slightest trace of damage on them.","This figure stood quietly beside Auriel, her golden eyes stared at Auriel coldly, and after a while, she slowly raised her hand, a layer of invisible and intangible power quickly Covered Auriel's body.","This is a battlefield like a meat grinder. The bloodthirsty demons never know what it means to retreat. After arriving from the flaming hell to the High Heaven, they continue to hit the city walls of the silver city, and the angels who come up to meet each other. In the fight, out of hatred for the power of the Holy Light, the demons did not need any command at all, and they spontaneously fought against the enemy.","This is an incredible phenomenon. Outside the invisible light film, everything is very usual, but Auriel in the light film seems to be fast-forwarded...","This is where the confidence of the High Heaven comes from. The sturdiness of the gates of diamonds and the city walls has been verified in countless eternal battles. Out of their trust in the gates of diamonds and the city walls, the angels execute them in an orderly manner.

As he soared through the void, Roy's senses gradually picked up the presence of the Imp he had left behind in the higher realms of heaven. The strengthening signal of their connection indicated that the direction he was heading was indeed leading towards the void, nearing the proximity of the material world. As long as he maintained his forward flight, he would eventually reach the very edge of the material world.","With the opening of the golden demon eyes, a body of the same color as the void appeared.

So what! Holy Light has nothing to fear!\" Imperius snorted coldly and activated the crimson light wings behind his back slammed together. And his whole body became like a stream, holding the spear of courage and rushing towards Roy.","\"I'm afraid we're in big trouble!\" Auriel changed her tone and her voice sounded very serious \"The power of Demon King Osiris is beyond imagination, he is not the king of demons in the conventional sense! When will the abyss world make such a monster!?\"","\"Let me take you for a ride!\" Imperius roared, as the potent holy light coalesced at the spear's tip. As he charged towards Roy, the concentrated holy light remained fixed, transforming into a colossal beam that hurtled towards Roy's head with fervor and intensity!","\"Let's go together!\" Tyrael's voice came and he said very cautiously \"I played against him before, I thought he was just not afraid of the Holy Light, but I really didn't expect him to do this, we must Find his weakness and use the power of authority!\"","\"Shut up! Demon!\"","\"Shut up!\" Seeing Tyrael's speechless appearance, Imperius stood up and scolded \"Demon, we are not here to argue with you! Tyrael, can't you see? Come out, he's just provoking us!\"","\"This... what kind of monster is this!?\" Angle of Hope - Auriel looked up at Roy in a stunned manner, even if they were all floating in the air, they still had to look up to see Roy's face.","\"Tsk tsk, it's this kind of speech that stands on the high point of morality! You angels are always like this...\" Roy shook his finger \"Tyrael, although you used to be called an archangel of justice, you really does not represent justice! In my opinion, the fight between angels and demons is not a fight between justice and evil, but just a boring fight... Look at the current situation in Sanctuary, the angels are fighting against each other. The Nephalems committed murder, even if you really claim to be righteous, tell me then, will you judge the culprit for this murder, your brother Imperius?\"","\"Where did this Demon King Osiris come from!?\" Tyrael also muttered to himself in surprise. When he was locked in the Soul Stone before, he was still a little unconvinced in his heart, thinking that he had been hit by Roy's conspiracy and tricks, he has not used the power of authority, but now after seeing Roy's true name liberation state, he realized that Roy also did not use all his strength to deal with him at that time.","After becoming a Chaos Demon, it was the first time that Roy had used this kind of power to deal with the enemy. In the past, he just tested it alone. Now, looking at it, the effect is beyond imagination in the process of fighting the enemy.","After using the power of authority, Imperius rushed to Roy again without fear, just like he had been doing for a long time, always charging at the forefront, even if he knew that the enemy's power was incomprehensible, he is fearless!","Among the demons, the huge size often means the strength...","As a main battle faction, Imperius was really tired of these verbal debates. He walked to the front, raised his right hand covered with golden armor, and saw a circular vortex hole immediately appeared in the clouds in the sky. The light quickly fell from the vortex and landed in front of Imperius.","As a result, when Imperius heard this, his nose was about to crook (if he had any) what is our internal problem? Could it be that you really want to judge me after the fact?","As for Angel of Destiny Itherael, his weapon is the Talus'ar in front of him, the scroll of destiny! He didn't show much of a fighting stance, but the scroll of destiny also became a lake beside him. The original golden scroll turned into a variety of weapons, and there was no fixed form.","But these are not the main ones. The main thing is that Roy suddenly changed from the dark wind to the Cthulhu wind. The four archangels found it a bit difficult to accept, they had never seen such a demon...","He flew back to Auriel and said without turning his head in surprise \"Absolute zero!? How is this possible, there are really creatures that can control the temperature to this level!?\"","Hearing that Roy actually said that he was a thief, Tyrael couldn't help it. He pointed at Roy with the holy sword and said, \"Even though I can't see your plan, this soul stone isn't your intention at all. Now, although you got your wish to find your soul stone and found the position of the High Heaven, don't even think about taking the soul stone back! In the name of High Heaven, we will judge you!\"","If they had to use words to describe their feelings at the moment, it might be the same feeling that humans look at the first machine... Roy's misty body has a natural advantage in visual effects and the four archangels have not seen it before. The real bodies of the demons of hell, but such a huge body, even the seven demons of deadly sin never had.","Imperius may not have seen it before, but now he has finally seen it. There is no thrilling big scene, but it looks extremely simple and strange. It was originally extremely active, with super high-energy holy light. But it break down those elemental particles called photons directly lost all activity and energy levels. The photons no longer glowed and the golden beam of light became pitch black, harmoniously blending into the deep darkness in Roy's palm.","Imperius stretched out his hand, pulled the spear of courage from the ground, and pointed the spear at Roy with one hand \"Come on, demon!

Her real archangel weapon is actually wrapped around her hands and arms, the streamer called Al'maiesh, also known as the 'Cord of Hope'! This long silk-like cord is usually wrapped around Auriel's body, and it is even part of Auriel's hood.","In a sense, this is very similar to the nulling effect of the void force...","In just a moment, Roy's entire painting style changed completely, and a chaotic demon with a height of dozens of meters appeared in front of the four archangels.","In the state of absolute zero, what will the frozen light beam look like?","It can't be said to be swallowed, nor can it be said to be assimilated, because the area in Roy's palm is a completely still and silent space, and all substances entering this area will completely stop.","No one would doubt the power of Imperius' strike, but in the face of the blasting beam of divine punishment, Roy just raised his left hand and blocked it in front of his face. In the palm of the mist, there was a touch of Incomparably intense and deep darkness was gathering, and the beam of light slowed down at a speed visible to the naked eye as it shot towards Roy's left hand!","Such a grand and majestic scene made Roy a little excited. Facing the four archangels at the same time, Roy didn't dare to care about holding back. He directly entered the state of liberation of his real name!","The darkness in Roy's palm did not dissipate after annihilating Imperius's divine punishment beam, but continued to spread. Imperius, who was close, immediately felt the strong chill that spread out, and he fought. He immediately pulled away and flew back.","The flesh and blood texture on his demon body disappeared, and the size of his entire body began to grow larger.

They floated in the air. The four people and four directions just surrounded Roy's position. In the silver city in the distance, there were countless The angels danced, and they were like dazzling stars, dotted all over the silver city, they sang the passionate angel battle song, cheering for the four archangels.","There was a sound of clang and the falling light turned into a huge golden spear, the it was inserted into the ground like that.

He guessed that the Demon King Osiris might be brewing something.","\"Alright, this time it's time to fight side by side!\" Tyrael laughed \"Imperius, I'm not talking about you, you charge alone every time, and we haven't been able to cooperate with you for a long time. The last time Diablo invaded the High Heaven was also...”","\"Damn it! These mists are incorporeal!\" Imperius cursed, but before he could readjust his stance, a cluster of black light erupted beneath his feet! It was as if it had been lying in wait for him at that precise spot...","\"Don't moved!\" Auriel saw that his thinking had recovered and then explained with relief \"You were engulfed by that dark space just now and I used the rope of hope to forcibly pull you out. But you didn't move after you came out...\"","\"How on earth are we going to attack him?\" Tyrael said with a headache \"That foggy body has no entity at all, even the wind can't blow it away, and the power of the Holy Light can't cause damage to him...\"","\"I realize it too!\" Imperius nodded and said, \"But the most important thing to be careful about is the dark absolute zero-degree space. Once caught, it will be over and it may killed you directly and the soul may not necessarily be can escape...\"","\"I'm on, this time I'll fight alongside Tyrael!\" Imperius said cautiously \"You and Itherael pay attention to assist us, because only your thread of hope can save us from that kind of darkness. Pull it out of space!\"","\"Im...pe...ri....s\"","\"Im...pe...rius...\"","\"Is it less than a second?\" Imperius raised his gaze to survey the battlefield and noticed Tyrael assuming his offensive stance, wielding the holy sword. Itherael was aiding him in the assault, while the demon king Osiris took charge. Reflecting on the recent encounter, Imperius couldn't help but feel a shiver down his spine, whispering, \"It felt as though I had been trapped in darkness for countless millennia... It was an utterly terrifying experience. Auriel, I am grateful to you for saving me.\"","\"It's done!\" Roy's soft voice rang out and then he saw that in all directions around the entire Silver City, a large number of Imps with small wings suddenly appeared in all directions!","\"Leave it to me!\" Auriel nodded.","\"Not good!\" Feeling the biting cold breath in the black light, Imperius immediately judged that it was the absolute zero-degree attack just now, but it was too late for him to flash again, and the surrounding black light burst out. That circle of space has been blocked by Roy's attack.","\"Open it up!\"","\"The nature of his power has changed too much!\" Tyrael said after seeing Imperius \"Osiris seems to be able to control all elemental powers, but these elemental powers are not in the conventional sense, but Mutant elemental power!\"","\"Trust me! Feeling of death is more heartwarming than that!\" Imperius said as he ignited the holy flame again. After leaving the absolute zero space, the holy flame on his body also turned the frost on his armor. Dispersed, but after the black ice crystals fell off, Imperius noticed that his armor had been damaged. Under the extreme cold, even if it was forged in the High Heaven holy light forge, The incomparably sturdy Archangel armor also had numerous tiny cracks, and these cracks were almost all over the body.","\"We need to use the power of Auriel!\" Imperius said \"With the power of her 'hope'!\"","\"Wha... What happened?\" Imperius asked in a hoarse voice, covering his head.","\"Yes... is it?\" Imperius asked, shaking his head vigorously, \"How long have I been in there?\"","A large number of Imps with wings are scattered all over the battlefield. After receiving Roy's magic power transmission, these Imps radiated bursts of light, the light continued to spread, and the portals were also destroyed.","Although the first blow was dodged by Imperius, pillars of hellfire erupted one after another on the ground, chasing his location and bombarding him constantly. Imperius had to change positions quickly and finally he flashed to the back of Roy. Positioning himself, seized the opportunity to counterattack. He jumped to Roy's back with guns in both hands, arched his body and inserted the tip of the gun into Roy's back.","Attacking the High Heaven is not Roy's job alone and he is not arrogant enough to think that he can attack the High Heaven alone. After he entered the High Heaven alone, he just stabilized his feet first.","Auriel couldn't feel what Imperius felt just now, and asked curiously, \"Is it really that scary?\"","Auriel replied \"It's just less than a second! When you launched an attack, Itherael judged that you were in danger. I shot the rope of hope according to the direction he instructed and the dark space was completely closed. In an instant, I pulled you out... Fortunately, if it was a little later, you might have been completely frozen...\"","Auriel's \"Hope\" authority may sound a little difficult to understand, but in fact it is a very unique power, because as long as \"Hope\" exists, it can bring \"Miracles\"!","Before, she used the rope of hope to pull Imperius out of Roy's absolute zero space, relying on this kind of 'miracle' power, even if there was only a slight possibility, she could rescue Imperius from it. Oh, Auriel can do it too, and with the power of fate, Ethereal predicts certain scenes and tells her it, and it's even easier for her to do it.","But now is not the time to pursue these things. When he saw Auriel nodding to him, Imperius knew that Auriel had understood his own mind, and Itherael was also by her side. Working together, he will definitely be able to find a way to defeat the Demon King Osiris. Now he just needs to keep attacking and attacking with Tyrael.","Facing Roy's huge body, his strike was like jumping into a fog, but he still didn't have the feeling of hitting as he expected. A hole was drilled in the middle and rushed out from the front of the chest.","Fighting has always been what Imperius is good at. In the course of thousands of years of battle, Imperius also has his own unique war wisdom. After thinking for a while, Imperius suddenly turned his head and looked at him. Auriel not far behind.","Fortunately, using the power of authority, Imperius can draw endless magic to repair the armor, it just takes a little time.","His attack landed, yet the weapon lacked any discernible impact. Astonished, Imperius swiftly evaded and vacated his previous position. No sooner had he moved away than a ferocious column of hellfire erupted from the ground beneath him. A sudden explosion ensued, and the fiery surge soared into the heavens, engulfing the very spot Imperius had just occupied.","However, before the two could launch an attack, they saw Roy, who had not moved much, slowly raised his arms. When the huge misty body made this action, the mist that was stirred up like ink flowed again.","Imperius gradually regained his senses, his vision slowly returning and the darkness dissipating. Before him stood a figure, initially shrouded in shadows, but gradually transforming into the familiar form of Auriel.","Imperius rushed into the hurricane without hesitation. Dozens of spear tips of the spear of courage appeared around him. These spear tips transformed by his holy light were also burning with powerful holy flames. Under the command of Imperius, these spear tips flew to various parts of the hurricane, although they exploded, offsetting the power of the hurricane with the force of the explosion.","Imperius' body turned into a ray of light and flew towards the battlefield. At this moment, Tyrael was caught in the fiery hurricane shot by Roy. In the powerful hurricane connecting the ground and the clouds at both ends, the violent destruction flames filled it. Just whistling and scrolling rapidly, Tyrael was in this fiery storm, being continuously burned, and he could only hold up the Holy Light Shield to resist with difficulty.","Imperius' face darkened when he heard this. The last time he faced Diablo, his old opponent, he was terribly beaten, making him angry when he remembered it. It was a humiliating defeat, but Tyrael This guy just doesn't open the pot and lifts it...","In just a moment, hundreds of thousands of demon armies have invaded the High Heaven, and the bell of war has been sounded...","In other words, this is a power that belongs to the European emperor...","Looking down and seeing him rushing towards him, Roy waved his hand and hit him with several huge black lightning bolts. However, at the moment when the lightning fell on Imperius's head, Imperius's body suddenly turned into a ray of light. Leap forward in the form of the speed of light, dodging the lightning strike.","Now, in the regular battle mode, the archangels can't deal with Roy, so they can only find a way to use Auriel to find a 'miracle' and gain insight into Roy's weakness. They believe that no matter how powerful the devil is, it is impossible Really invincible.","Now, with the completion of the arrangement of the Imps, it is time for the war to enter the next step.","Ten, hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of portals opened at the same time, which was already the limit of Roy's magic power, and as soon as these portals opened, a lot of terrifying roars came from door to door.","The black lightning kept adjusting its position and falling, but Imperius avoided it by leaping forward. His figure flashed flexibly on the battlefield, approaching Roy quickly from left to right.","The endless darkness in front of him continued for such a long time, and it seemed as if 10,000 years had passed by Imperius, until an ethereal voice slowly entered his mind.","The key now is how to break the game. There must be some way to kill the Demon King Osiris. Otherwise, if they keep fighting like this, they will definitely be the four angels who will fail in the end.","The so-called 'miracle' here refers to certain events with super small probability. If a battle has a 99.99% chance of failure and only a 0.01% chance of victory, then Auriel's power is to lead everyone to find that 0.01 % The power of victory!","The strong cold air of absolute zero broke out in this small space, causing the flaming holy flame on Imperius to be suppressed back to the surface of the body, and the armor on his body instantly condensed frost. The speed of light was severely slowed down. Imperius only felt that all the horizons in front of him were suddenly plunged into endless darkness, he could no longer see any colors and things. His movements were stopped almost instantly and his thinking began to slow down.","The voice that came into his mind, at first every word had to be delayed for a long time, and then the interval was gradually shortened, the finally turned into an anxious shout.","These Imps are the ones that he kept spreading out just now. The reason why he has been passively defending against Imperius and Tyrael's attacks is that he is arranging and spreading these Imps.","This time, Imperius did not attack Roy's head, but held the spear of courage and slashed at Roy's waist horizontally. With the movement of his spear, a huge arc-shaped flame The chopping wave appeared, and a gap was directly torn out of Roy's waist.","Tyrael immediately understood when he heard it.","When the fiery storm dissipated, Tyrael was also rescued. His originally dark face was now red because of the high temperature and it looked really black, red and translucent.","When the first demon jumped out of the portal, demons jumped out from all the portals one after another. In less than ten seconds, all the portals started to pour out like dumplings and kept spitting out Demon army...","With holy flames burning all over his body, Imperius took the lead and rushed to Roy again."]}],[{"i":"522-battle-of-power-and-power","l":"522: Battle of Power and Power","p":["\"Auriel, what's going on!?\" Itherael asked anxiously.","\"Come with me, Angle of Hope - Auriel...\" Roy's grinning voice came out from his mouth and Auriel's body also became illusory after being stabbed.","\"Dammit!\"","\"Does it work?\" Auriel waited until the explosion passed, and asked Tyrael, who was still holding the sword inserted into the humanoid body.","\"Don't you dare!\"","\"He... he is resisting the binding force of the Hope Cord!\" Auriel said with difficulty, she was trying her best to control her Hope Cord, but the resistance from the inside was getting stronger and stronger and she was already at her limit.","\"Hold on!\" Itherael shouted, flapping his wings and flying to where Tyrael and Roy were. The scroll of fate he was holding changed into a golden hammer at this moment. He swung the heavy hammer vigorously and smashed it on the wrist of the humanoid body. With the percussion of the ground and the cooperation of Auriel, Tyrael was finally rescued.","\"Huh!?\" Roy was also a little surprised. He didn't expect Auriel to have such a trick. At this moment, Roy was like being enclosed and his misty body was trapped in a Inside the human-shaped body, he couldn't get out of it for a while.","\"I don't know...\" Tyrael was not sure and shook his head \"Would you like to open it and take a look?\"","\"No, it can't be opened!\" Itherael's voice came: \"I saw the picture of him getting out of trouble...\"","\"Not good! Rush out quickly!\" Imperius shouted, leading Tyrael, Auriel and Itherael to find a direction and to break through. After rushed for a short distance, the front Roy's demon king's face suddenly appeared in the fog and three gray rays of light burst out from his three demon eyes, hitting Tyrael, Auriel, and Itherael behind Imperius.","A huge misty claw clenched into a fist and slammed into Imperius's gun barrel. At the moment of the hit, the fist turned into a solid body, followed by a powerful burst of power, and the huge body strengthened Roy's power, after being doubled by Red Dragon Emperor gauntlet, formed an irresistible powerful force shock! The barrel of the Gun of Courage was bent 90 degrees at the moment it was hit. The barrel hit Imperius' chest, and the force passed on collapsed the armor on Imperius' chest. Knocking Imperius into the air in an instant!","After Auriel was blown away by the gray light, the first time she woke up, she saw the image of Imperius being knocked away. Her calm and harmonious voice couldn't help but change and she charged with a long sword and a long spear. When Roy was approaching the mist, the rope of hope that was wrapped around her arms suddenly increased in length, wrapping around Roy's huge mist body from both sides.","After changing his passive defensive stance, Roy started to take the initiative to attack this time. The huge misty wing behind him slammed into the ground, and they saw the overwhelming black flames appear in the entire sky, the black flames dissipated. Clouds and mists within a few thousand meters rolled towards the four archangels.","After Itherael and Tyrael heard the shouts, they didn't even think about it. One held the pierced sword hilt, the other turned the scroll of fate into a scepter and pressed it on the humanoid body, and the two At the same time, the man chanted the exorcism incantation.","Although the real name of Roy's demon was not known, the two archangels joined forces to forcefully banish him, and the incantation still had its effect. The bound humanoid body began to become illusory. It will be repelled by the material world and then exiled into the void.","As if the length of these long ropes can be extended indefinitely, they rotate rapidly, entangling Roy's huge body, and at the same time the entire rope of hope","At the same time, Tyrael also roared and flew over. He held the brilliance of the holy feather in his hand, and stabbed the sword through the gap in the rope of hope. He gathered the powerful holy light at the tip of the sword, and then Inside this mortal body, the power of the Holy Light was directly detonated!","Auriel and Itherael let out a roar at the same time, trying to reach out to grab Auriel, but it was too late, Roy and Auriel disappeared in front of them...","Back then, Lilith was exiled by Inarius like this...","Banishing spells, also known as banishing spells, to be honest, neither Tyrael nor Itherael have used this trick for a long time. If it wasn't for Auriel's reminder, they would have forgotten about it. This move, but Auriel should have seen a 'miracle' before letting them do it, so the two chose to believe in Auriel without hesitation.","Boom!","bump! A sound came, and the moment the army of demons and monsters rushed to the city wall of the Silver City, it immediately inspired the protective barrier of the entire Silver City, and the golden holy light formed a huge semi-circular protective barrier in the blink of an eye. The shield covered the entire city, and it was this shield that the demons and monsters collided with for the first time.","But at this time, a sudden change occurred, and a huge force came, which suddenly pulled Auriel and flew her over. Although the rope of hope was wrapped around Roy's misty body, but the source It was also pulling Auriel. Under Roy's tremendous strength, Auriel was pulled in front of Roy, and before Tyrael and the others could react to stop it, a ferocious long sword suddenly appeared in front of him and into Roy's hands.","Countless demons and monsters swarmed from the many open portals like a flood.","Even ordinary monsters, out of disgust for the power of the Holy Light, after they came to the High Heaven, they involuntarily launched a charge with the demons. Such a large number of demons and monsters gathered together, and the pollution caused by the dark power was Very terrifying, these dark forces in turn stimulated their bloodthirsty instincts, so on the battlefield, the army of the dark camp was seen frantically launching a tsunami-like attack wave against the silver city.","Except for some of these demons that were directly summoned from the Hell of Flames, the rest almost came from all over the Sanctuary. Diablo and the seven demon kings have been operating in the Sanctuary world for many years, leaving behind the dark power A large number of creatures have been corrupted, resulting in an astonishing number of monsters formed. The Imps that Roy spread out at the beginning stayed in the wilderness. Once the portal was opened, these guys were attracted.","Fortunately, at this time, the angel army in the silver city also reacted. A large number of angel warriors waved their light wings, flew high into the sky with weapons in their hands, and rushed over the city wall to the demons and monsters outside. In order to reduce the pressure on the barrier, They can only place the battlefield outside the enchantment.","Frostmourne!","Hearing this, Tyrael cursed \"Damn! Do it again!\"","However, at this moment, Auriel's hollow hood suddenly lit up with light like eyes, and she seemed to have received some kind of revelation, shouting to Itherael \"Exile him! I see he can be banished! \"","However, before the words fell, the husk formed by the rope of hope moved. Tyrael's neck was pinched by the right hand raised by the husk, and a mass of curse flames rose from where Tyrael was pinched. Get up and start burning Tyrael's head!","However, doing this means that they can no longer enjoy the protection of the enchantment. The armies of both sides fought on the battlefield with real swords and guns. Every moment, you can see the splashing out of demons and monsters when they are cut open. Flesh and blood, you can also see the scene of the angel dissipating into light after being besieged.","However, the shield proved inadequate in repelling the relentless onslaught of demons and monsters. Those creatures scorched by the holy light found themselves trapped with no means of escape. Pressed by the ceaseless tide of advancing monsters, their only recourse was to engage in frenzied combat, wielding weapons or resorting to biting with razor-sharp teeth and claws. Meanwhile, certain magical entities bombarded the shield with a barrage of spells and projectiles, employing every possible method to breach the protective barrier of light.","However, with all the explosive force, Auriel, who was supported by her gnashing teeth, was bound in the body of the Cord of Hope, which aggravated the destructive power of the Holy Light.","If they dare to dodge, this huge cloud of hellfire will smash into the barrier shield of the Silver City, so Imperius and the others can only choose to join forces to block these clouds of hellfire, they inspired their respective archangel weapons, A circular shield was formed in the air, blocking the path of the hellfire cloud.","Imperius and the others were struggling to support it, but this mental storm lasted for more than five minutes before it finally dissipated. Protecting these black lightnings consumes more energy than protecting ordinary lightning. When the storm dissipated, it could be seen that the four archangels and even the light wings behind them were darkened a lot.","Imperius and Tyrael wanted to command the army to fight, especially Imperius, he was the supreme commander of the entire High Heaven, but before he could call for an order, they were entangled by Roy.","Imperius, who was flew alone, looked back and saw this scene. Before he had time to check the situation of the three, he quickly turned his head and blocked with the spear of courage in front of him.","It is conservatively estimated that Roy's blow can send him hundreds of kilometers away, which is beyond the horizon of most creatures...","It was just a collision of force, and the tens of kilometers in which the two sides were fighting had been completely emptied. The demons avoided this area in fear and the angels also flew around this area as soon as possible. There were no creatures at all that dare to approach.","Only then did Tyrael use the power of the Holy Light to completely extinguish the flames that burning on his face, but after a while, Tyrael's face was burned beyond recognition. Formed into a group, the humanoid husks that were struggling to fight for control with Auriel didn't know how to attack for a while.","Raising their heads, the four archangels discovered that they were surrounded by a mist that flowed like ink and wash on Roy's body, as if they had entered Roy's body.","Relying on the power of the Holy Light, the four archangels neutralized the waves of hellfire set off by Roy. However, before they could catch their breath, a ball of thunder light thrown by Roy erupted in mid-air. Countless black filaments of lightning flashed erupted in a circular area. This is a spiritual storm imitating the skills of the [2] Protoss Archon. The dark lightning power directly to the soul continues to rage in this area and there are countless lightning every second. The shield of light that bombarded the four archangels.","Roy's Imps are scattered over the entire battlefield, which is equivalent to surrounding the entire silver city in all directions. This way, it has larger contact area. The first contact and attack the shield of the Holy Light enchantment. The more demons and monsters there are, even if the protective ability of the Holy Light Barrier in the Silver City is very strong, when facing so many monsters attacking at the same time, the energy will drop rapidly for a while.","Seeing that the body became illusory, Auriel was also ready to cut off her own rope of hope. Although doing so would lose part of the rope of hope, it might even destroy the archangel weapon, but in order to achieve her goal, she was still prepared to do so.","The battle, from the very beginning, entered a state of intense heat...","The flames hit their golden shields of holy light, darkness and holy power collided, and a huge shock wave erupted. Some demons and monsters that got close were instantly burnt to ashes, fluttering in the sky and unable to escape. The angels also turned into light with a painful roar and even their armor was melted into liquid and dripped to the ground.","The holy light that condensed all the power of an archangel broke out and countless golden rays of light leaked out from the gaps in the rope of hope, making this mortal body that bound Roy like an object that leaked light from all sides, and then It was an earth-shattering explosion!","The whole battlefield was watched the angels and demons, they all saw that Imperius was knocked out of the mist formed by Roy's body, turned into a streamer and shot directly into the sky, and disappeared like a star.","There is also a blue light on it. These blue light forms a power similar to an enchantment, which blocks the emission of Roy's misty body and binds the invisible and intangible mist within the bounds of the entanglement.","This gray light was emitted at the speed of light, so fast that it was too late for people to react. The Holy Light shield that Auriel and the other three were directly penetrated by the gray light, and the light hit directly. Their bodies caused a strong explosion, which directly blew the three back and flew out.","Tyrael was desperately clenching the wrist of the body, trying to break free from the restraint, but the power from this hand was so great that he couldn't break free for a while.","With a screeching sound, the tip of Frostmourne's sword pierced into Auriel's abdomen, and the angel exorcism spell on the sword was also activated!"]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["Name Changes","Reference to star craft world"]}],[{"i":"523---devils-poem","l":"523 - Devil's Poem","p":["\"Archangel Auriel, what are you waiting for?

Under normal circumstances, regardless of the curse's intensity, she could rely on the Holy Light to counteract its effects. However, in this void environment, her access to the Holy Light was nonexistent, leaving her power severely restricted.","\"The void will slowly erode you a little bit, and eventually devour you, and the power of the Holy Light you are proud of can no longer protect you.\"","\"You are in the depths of the void, the backside of the material world.

After becoming the Demon King, the power of Frostmourne's curse was also strengthened accordingly, so it was also effective for an archangel like Auriel, but Auriel did not choose to deal with it. This wound made Roy understand her thoughts for the first time.","As the time goes on, this curse will be cured without medicine. It can be said that Auriel has made a mistake.","Attacking the High Heaven is part of his plan. Now there are only three of the four archangels left. Of course, Roy can't let Auriel go back to add obstacles to him.","Auriel curled up in place, wrapped her body with her light wings, and waited motionlessly. She didn't know how long she could hold on, nor how long it would take for Imperius and Tyrael to be able to do it. Take yourself back, but as long as there is a glimmer of hope, Auriel will not give up.","Auriel is not indecisive. After thinking for a while, she chose to let the curse power go.","Auriel is the archangel, and Roy is not sure how much effect this corruption curse has on her, but he decided to continue and slightly modified the words in the whispering voice.","Auriel was originally fighting against the erosion of the void, while being distracted to resist the influence of the curse, but suddenly, the whispering voice that echoed in her mind suddenly became much clearer.","Because when Roy created Frostmourne, he made it according to the ability of Frostmourne in his memory, so those who have been hit by this corruption curse will continue to hear from their souls during the duration of the curse. Whispering sound, this murmuring sound is usually the echo of the subconscious deep in their hearts, which will continue to amplify the dark side of their hearts, increase their negative emotions, and eventually lead to the corruption and degeneration of those who are recruited.","But then she discovered that the shield of holy light did not glow, or that she could not see the light of the shield, but could only feel the power of the holy light on the shield, which was escaping and dissipating rapidly.","Certainly, Auriel has heard of the void, but she has never truly encountered it. In her understanding, the void represents an eternal abyss of darkness, fraught with constant perils. Such perception instills a sense of caution within her, preventing any hint of complacency. Hence, even as she notices the power dissipating, she resolutely endeavors to uphold the protective shield, exerting her utmost effort.","Compared with Roy, the guy who is open, Auriel is not so lucky. Her current situation is very bad.","Facing the strange environment of the void, she subconsciously activated the shield of light to cover her entire body to prevent unknown damage.","Hope, this is her authority, she will always wait for the moment when the miracle comes...","However, this is the case between angels and demons. There is no reason for hostility. If he and Auriel change their positions and become Roy, they can only stick to waiting for help and Auriel can act on her own in the void. I believe Auriel will also take action to deal with Roy without hesitation.","However, this refers to the absence of external interference... and now Roy is by her side!","If she chooses to clear the power of the curse, it means that she will be able to persist in the void environment for less time, and if she chooses to let go first, she can persist in the void for a longer time, but the curse will cause more damage to her.","It is said that in the void, the speed of pure magic dissipating is slow, then the elemental spells converted from magic will dissipate more than ten times faster. When she finds out that her holy light cannot be replenished in this void at all, she finally try calmed down, but it was already a little late. At least half of her magic power was converted into holy light and dissipated.","It was not until Roy completed his self-evolution and could see in the void with the help of the newly born Eye of the Void, that he discovered where Auriel was.","Now, Roy's wings can no longer be called the Wings of the Mist, but should be called the [Wings of the Void]...","Originally, in the eyes of an archangel of hope like Auriel, the world is colorful, splendid, beautiful, full of light of harmony and hope. Auriel has long been accustomed to this perception, but when she After falling into the void, all hope and goodness disappeared.","Roy is not in a hurry, his curse power, left a mark on Auriel, and it is also a coordinate.

In that case, he will probably not be able to get along in the abyss in the future - so he only Can play the idea of High Heaven.","Roy knew that Auriel didn't have any perception of the outside world, so he boldly stretched out his fingertips and released a small mass of chaotic energy at the position of Auriel's wound, covering the wound thinly. In this way, the chaotic power is isolated, and the dissipation of the curse power stops immediately.","Roy knew that she was giving priority to fighting against the erosion of the void, but Auriel didn't seem to realize that the cursed power was also a kind of dark power in the material world, that is to say, the cursed power attached to her wound was actually eroded by the void.

If she can successfully regain access to the high-heaven, the curse afflicting the sword of Demon King Osiris will be eradicated. Conversely, should she be unable to endure an extended period within the void, risking severe erosion from its power, her return to the higher realms could potentially bring immense trouble to the material world.","So since Auriel was discovered, Roy couldn't let her go because of admiration... it's just impossible.","So, now Auriel is faced with a choice, should she concentrate on eliminating this cursed power first, or should she just let it go?","Speaking of enemies, Roy remembered that creatures can actually be born in the void, and each of those void creatures is extremely dangerous, but I don't know if they will encounter them in this void.","The erosion of void power seems to cause corruption. Auriel has heard a little about this. In her opinion, the corruption of the void is much more serious than the corruption of the dark power...","The void world seems to have its own set of rules. After gaining the ability to move, Roy came to Auriel's side, but Auriel did not notice his arrival at all, and Roy floated on Auriel's body. Beside him, he could even smell the holy light on Auriel when he lowered his head a little (if there is a smell spreading in the void), but Auriel just didn't notice it.","Then, she found an even bigger trouble. Her abdomen was stabbed by the magic sword of Osiris, but it did not heal. A very powerful curse force prevented the elementalization process of her body and the position of her abdomen was transparent. The gap remains there.","This sentence was so clear that it kept echoing in Auriel's mind over and over again, repeating, although Auriel also knew that it was the influence of the curse, but she couldn't block the murmur, you can only empty your mind as much as possible to reduce this interference.","This situation made Roy feel a little funny, but he also secretly feared that the void environment was so dangerous. The enemy was so close that he didn't know anything about it. If you encounter any enemy, you really don't know how to die.","To be honest, although Roy pulled Auriel into the void at the last moment of his exile, he actually had no hatred for Auriel. It's just a random selection of a lucky opponent. Aside from the natural hostility between angels and demons, he still admires Auriel.

Under this condition, Roy's magic power can be supplemented again.","At this moment, Roy has been released from the state of true name liberation and restored to his original material body.","Because the spear of courage in his hand has been completely bent...","Being in the void is a feeling that is difficult to describe accurately. Roy feels that he is not as good as a blind person. There is nothing around him that can be fed back to make him feel, and even the eyes of Godhead cannot see any information.","But if you think about it carefully, this is not a long-term solution, because there is no substance in the void, and when there is no element around, the magic power cannot be replenished. If this continues, the magic power will always be used up.","But no matter what, when the Eye of the Void appeared, Roy was finally able to \"see\" things, and he saw the changes in his body for the first time, and he was also amazed at this alienation.","But now, there is an archangel and a demon king who are experiencing this feeling.","Contrary, it's actually really useful. When the magic power is spread all over the body, the magic power will be dissipated, and the cells of the self will stop dissipating.","Due to the lack of external perception, Roy didn't know where he was flying towards the void. He could only walk aimlessly. Even though there was no concept of distance in the void, he didn't know what he was flying like this. Really fly away, or stay in place.","Except for itself and time.","He also knew that the first task now was to repel the attack of the demon army and finding Auriel's position from the void was a meticulous job and they didn't have so much time to do this now.","He realized that it was impossible for him to explore the void like this. He didn't even know how big the void was. Flying down like this was just a waste of time. He had to find a way to restore his perception in the void.","Here, there is no light, no air, no dust, no water molecules, not even electromagnetic waves, and no radiation field. The darkness is not because the place is full of dark elements, on the contrary, this darkness is because there is nothing.","However, Imperius couldn't hold back the anger in his heart. The loss of Auriel, his sister, made his heart hurt, but it seemed that he cared more about not being able to defeat Osiris with his own hands and wash away his shame..","However, when he rushed back to the battlefield outside the Diamond Gate, he was stunned. The Demon King Osiris disappeared and Auriel also disappeared. Only Tyrael and Itherael were standing there with their heads down.","I have to say that this is really Roy's only weakness right now, or as long as it is a creature from an alien world, exile is their common weakness, even in a man-made world like Sanctuary, even if the world itself is more exclusive Small, but with an inherently weak connection to the world with alien creatures, which is why the exile was able to succeed.","If it's just temporarily unavailable, it's not a big deal for Imperius, but the problem is that his weapon, already broke once! It was the time when Diablo gathered the power of the Seven Demon Kings to enter the High Heaven, the spear of courage was damaged by Diablo and Imperius spent a lot of effort to recast the spear of courage. It didn't take long for Roy's fist to give it a damage again...","Imperius pushed him away, roaring pitifully \"Then what are you still doing here now!?\" Why not quickly bring Auriel back from the void?\"","Imperius roared angrily, venting all his anger on these demons who were beyond their own power. He did not kill these demons with his own weapon, neither the gun of courage, but just set off a monstrous holy flame and swept over them.","In fact, because the devil children scattered in the High Heaven are related to Roy himself, this is a system creation after all, and the attribute definition given by Roy can't even completely erase the isolation of the void. Tt is only possible Because he is in the depths of the void, this connection has become very weak now.","In the end, it may completely turn into a part of the void...","It can be said that it is not even exist and he cannot feel the existence of any space here. He does not even know whether he is in a certain space.","It is not broken, but it is bent at a 90-degree angle, which is no different from being broken, which means that Imperius cannot use this archangel weapon temporarily until it is repaired.","It must be boring and useless to do this, so after a while, Roy stopped.","It seems that the prophecy has begun to be fulfilled again...","It's better to go back to the furnace and recast it directly...","It's not easy to do this. There is no sense of direction in the void. You don't know whether you are advancing or retreating in the void, whether you are swimming towards the material world, or swimming deeper into the void. What is is this? It is impossible to say for sure, coupled with the fact that he has been eroded by the power of the void, the shadow and crisis of this slow death has always been shrouded in his head, and there are very few who can really hold on.","Itherael and Tyrael looked at Imperius's back from behind, they were also sensitively aware of Imperius's emotional changes. They both recalled the previous revelation on the scroll of fate, which came from The Prophecy of the Book of Cain for Mortals.","Judging from the speed of dissipation, this time may take a long time, but once the magic power is completely exhausted and there is no substitute, then it will be completely unable to resist the erosion of the void, and can only carry it with one's own body.","Killing those ordinary demons could not relieve the anger in his heart at all. Now he just wanted to rush back to the battlefield and fight Roy for life and death. This humiliation can only be washed away with the demon blood of the demon king.","Looking at the gun of courage in his hand and at the chaotic battlefield, Imperius finally said nothing, turned his head and left with a cold snort.","Luckily, Itherael explained at this time \"Sorry, Imperius, when Tyrael and I joined forces to exile Osiris, we used almost all our strength. He was exiled to the depths of the void, and there is no chance for him to return. After a long time, we can use the power of void erosion to completely destroy him, so...\"","No one knows what method Lilith came back through, but there is a precedent for her return, so the archangels of the High Heaven did not take the method of exile in the void against their old rivals, the Seven Demon Kings, Instead, he chose to use the dark soul stone for soul imprisonment.","Of course, Roy couldn't let his substance just dissipate in the void, so he tried to use his magic power to stop this dissipating.","On Roy's chest, a peculiar ocular feature was positioned. A vertical row of thorns adorned the middle of his chest, capable of parting to reveal a massive eyeball at the center. Unlike his previous third eye, this particular ocular manifestation took the form of a pure black crystalline sphere, brimming with an eerie presence.","One can imagine how angry Imperius is in his heart at the moment. For him, whether it is Diablo or Osiris, one by one is catching his gun and smashing it. This is simply a test of his courage and battle. A mockery of the will, proud as Imperius, how could he possibly endure such humiliation?","Putting away Frostmourne, in the system space that still can be use, but because there is nothing around, Roy can feel that his magic power is slowly radiating and draining around, not only magic power, but those on his body that are invisible to the naked eye. Yes, the cells of the body are also slowly spreading from the entire body surface into the void. The substances emitted from these bodies, after touching the void, also disappear out of thin air, as if they never existed.","Raising his head, Roy looked around, and he also saw things in this void.","Realizing that this would not work, Roy could only turn his body into a chaotic state. In fact, when the Devil May Cry world faced the void, Roy found that the erosion of the void was useless to him in the chaotic state!","So far, in the world of Sanctuary, or the world of Diablo, there is only one recorded case that has returned from the void, and that is Lilith!","The first thing that caught my eye was the figure of Archangel Auriel!","The most vexing issue lies in the constant damage inflicted upon Roy's fist. In other words, while Imperius does not require a spear of courage to be re-forged, he must find a means to realign the spear's shaft, ensuring perfect synchronicity with himself. Even the slightest deviation in curvature would impair the tactile feedback he receives when wielding it.","The previous time was just a guess, but this time it was completely confirmed that the chaotic state is the only state that can resist the erosion of the void!","This eye of the void can also absorb a certain amount of void power in the void and store it in the eyeball separately. This is set up by Roy for the convenience of studying void power in the future. Void power is a very dangerous power, but since Roy can fight against it, then it is not too dangerous in Roy's eyes. Preserving a certain amount of void power can avoid tearing apart the barriers of the material world in order to study the void in the future.","This is actually an \"anchor point\" theory, which is not too unusual.","This is more troublesome than casting. Even if it is really straightened, the fist mark on the gun body will be difficult to fix. When he uses it in the future, as long as he sees the mark on it, he will remember the shame of being punched away today.","This is the name that Roy named his newly added eyeball. Roy set that when this eyeball is opened, he can obtain a unique \"Void Vision\" in the void environment, so that he can observe the situation in the void.","This is the way to escape from the void. In fact, it is not just him, other people who have been exiled to the void can also return through a similar method. Of course, the premise is that they can also have a way to hold the void like Roy. Having the ability to Fight Erosion and the ability to \"swim\" from the depths of the void back to the fringes of the material world with the loss of all senses...","This kind of angry emotion, in the depths of Imperius's heart, burned more and more, and was about to devour him.","This kind of dissipation, to be precise, should be some kind of replacement process, because the void is nothingness, and the process of dissipation is that the void replaces Roy with it little by little...","This situation is completely different from when the world of Devil May Cry repaired the cracks and touched the void. At that time, it was probably because of the large area of ​​contact with the material world, so the void at that time was violent and dangerous, but now it is Roy is in the void, and the contact area of ​​matter is small, so the erosion of the void appears much quieter, and it feels quite silent.","Time seems to exist here, because Roy can still move, which means that time has not stopped here, otherwise, he should be completely unable to move, and since he can move, it shows that Roy still has control over himself.","To be honest, since becoming a chaotic demon, Roy has rarely used the system interface to improve his strength, because his own chaotic power has given him enough combat power, but now facing the situation of the void, Roy has It is necessary for Roy to carry out another \"evolution\"!","Void, what is it like?","What Roy didn't expect was that her position in the void was not far from where Roy was...","Whether it's an angel or a demon, there are actually quite a few who have witnessed the void, but basically there is only an impression of \"infinite darkness\", but the real void, or what it is like to be in the void, no one knows.","Within the streak, a figure emanated a majestic aura of holy light. The angelic warriors on the battlefield immediately recognized the identity of this figure, swiftly making way for its passage. The airborne demons, witnessing the scene, emitted eerie screams in an attempt to halt the figure's advance.","Yes, Roy did not choose to make any item this time, but chose to perform an evolution, he added an eye to himself, a huge eye!","Yet, their efforts were futile, for those who obstructed the figure met a grim fate. The fiery red streak pierced through them without hesitation, leaving their charred bodies ablaze with holy flames as they plummeted from the skies."]}],[{"i":"526---roys-true-intentions","l":"526 - Roy's true intentions","p":["\"...\" Tyrael floated motionless in the air, thinking about Roy's words, but after a while, the dejected light in Tyrael's eyes disappeared, he raised his head and looked at Roy and said, \"No! It's not me. There is a problem with the cognition of authority and power, but you! Demon King Osiris, you have no malice towards this world, right!?”","\"...Understandable!\" Tyrael took a deep breath and said \"Whether you are deceiving me or not, I also understand the reason why you attacked the High Heaven you want to expel all the angels Without the angels, the eternal battle will be over, and the seven demon kings and demons can also return to the abyss world, and you, with your great record of conquering the High Heaven, can protect the world of Sanctuary from the hands of the seven demon kings?\"","\"Ah, the material world is better!\" Roy sighed, then looked down, stretched out his hand and used his sharp index finger and thumb nail to twist up a nearby upper rank demon. The upper rank demon was about two meters high, but In front of Roy's misty body, he looked so short. He was grabbed by the back of his neck and hung in the air by Roy. He didn't dare to move at all.","\"Archangel Tyrael, I don't know how long you have been trapped in this world...\" Roy raised his head and said, \"Unlike you, I have been to many different worlds, and I have witnessed many angels Fallen, since even angels can fall, why do you dare to say that angels are righteous Tyrael? There seems to be a problem with your cognition of your authority and power!\"","\"As your command!\"","\"Basically!\" Roy nodded and said, \"If Mephisto and the other old men disagree, maybe I might have a fight with them...\"","\"Damn, when did such a monster-like demon appear in the abyss world!?\" Tyrael was dripping with cold sweat on his forehead. He glanced around, but he couldn't see Auriel coming back with him. He knew that it was troublesome, and that Auriel might have an accident.","\"Damnit! In the name of justice, I must defeat you!\" Tyrael avoided Roy's slash, waved his light wings and launched countless holy light bullets at Roy, but Roy's body suddenly disintegrated and turned into countless fist-sized individuals. All of these individuals were exactly the same as Roy's. With the help of the clone of the Heart of the Swarm, none of the holy light bullets that Tyrael shot densely hit, all of which were dodge by Roy.","\"Go and inform Imperius immediately!\" Tyrael grabbed an angel warrior beside him and said anxiously \"Tell him the news of Osiris's return from the void and let him come and help!\"","\"How is it possible? How is it possible!?\"","\"How long have I been away?\" Roy asked him.","\"Let's see, when I think so... that's it!\"","\"Mephisto didn't tell me the truth, they actually got out of trouble. The reason they really came to me may be to deal with another person...\" Roy shook his head. He was talking about Lilith, but he didn't say that. It was necessary to tell Tyrael too clearly, he said \"As for myself, I actually really want to keep the world of Sanctuary. I plan to get a... playground for my children!?\"","\"No, my child is also a Nephalem!\" Roy's words were astonishing, making Tyrael even dumbfounded.","\"Playground? Your child?\" Tyrael frowned. \"A... demon prince?\"","\"Then what do you want to do?\" Tyrael asked suspiciously \"Didn't you come because of Mephisto? What else can the Seven Devils want to do other than destroy the world of Sanctuary?\"","\"This... how is this possible? You are lying to me!?\" Tyrael couldn't believe it and roared \"Is it fun to fool me?\"","\"What am I lying to you for? Is there any benefit?\" Roy glanced at him angrily and said, \"That is my adopted son Sareth, in another world, he is called the dark messiah. In that world, whether it is an angel, a human, or a demon, everyone wants to kill him. I brought him back to the abyss world and raised him... Sareth is a good boy, but the abyss world is not very suitable for him, where he will only be a demon in the end, and he should have more options... He is still young, but he will always grow up, the world of Sanctuary is full of nephalems, so it counts It's his countryman, maybe he can live unfettered in this world...\"","\"Why are you so angry?\" Roy grinned and slammed his sword on his sword, smashing him several meters away.Then Roy rushed up, Frostmourne slashed at Tyrael's light wings, saying \"You guys It should be understood that since I dare to enter the High Heaven alone, it is natural for me to rely on me! Don't you still think that I am bluffing?\"","\"Why!? Why can you come back from the void!?\" Tyrael asked angrily loudly while fighting Roy \"What kind of demon are you!?\"","\"You...\" Tyrael got stuck at the moment, yes, think about it carefully, after the Demon King Osiris came to the world of Sanctuary, it seems that he did not kill any mortals, at least he did not kill or harvest over the soul of any mortal, since he came, he has been more hidden behind the scenes.","\"Your Majesty Osiris, your aura just disappeared from the battlefield for about four hours...\" the upper demon replied respectfully.","After he came to this world, there were only two things he really did. One was to imprison Tyrael's soul and the other was to lead the demon army into the High Heaven.","After speaking, Roy also nodded and admitted generously \"Yes, it is different from what you imagined. From the beginning, I never thought about destroying the world of Sanctuary!\"","But then a strange thing happened. All the angel warriors who were hit by the purple lightning did not receive any elemental damage. The moment they were hit, they were wrapped in a purple halo. A soft sound came, and the bodies of the angel warriors disappeared, replaced by all kinds of...food that fell from the sky!?","Hearing his words, Roy paused the attack, took back all the clones of the swarm, and re-condensed his body. Roy looked at Tyrael who was panting across from him and said with a smile \"Why is it not possible Tyrael? Mephisto told me something about your power and authority, your holy sword seems to be able to cut through all evil, but I want to ask you, after I came to this world, have I done anything evil?\"","Hearing this, Roy pondered for a while, and finally said","However, apart from a group of angel warriors who responded quickly in front, the angels who were charging at a high speed behind them were too late. Although they tried their best to fly upwards, the extremely fast lightning had already rushed to them, and they saw that they were about to be hit by lightning. they can only try their best to strengthen their shields of light and want to resist the attack of lightning power.","In the next second, the eyes of these demons who were lucky enough to pick up the food lit up!","It can also be seen from this point that the demons are still very efficient in executing orders. Roy did not have any instructions when he was exiled. The demons have always followed the initial attack order. They haven't slack off for a while.","Roy felt that it had been a little long since the four disappeared, but for Tyrael, his eyes were full of horror. He never thought that Roy would come back so quickly!","Roy looked at him in surprise and said, \"Huh? You actually reacted?\"","Roy nodded, four hours, it's been a little long, so he left the upper demon, and then observed the situation on the battlefield. Roy found that the demons did a good job, at least the enchantment of the silver city was beaten Broken.","Roy perceived Tyrael's lingering uncertainty and grinned mischievously. \"Tyrael, do you not find it contradictory that attacking your own angels is considered evil? Well, it seems your sword doesn't share that sentiment! In this world, the notion of justice upheld by your higher realms of heaven appears to be quite questionable!\"","Roy, in turn, shrunk the misty body to a height of more than three meters, then took out Frostmourne and slashed Tyrael. The battle between the two detonated a large energy shock wave, surrounding The demons and angels all screamed and avoided.","Seeing hundreds of streamers from the sky flying towards him, Roy sneered, raised his palm and aimed at the charging angel army. In the next second, countless purple lightning bursts appeared in his palm. These purple lightnings turned into a large net that enveloped the Angel Legion.","So delicious! Not only can you taste the flavor of the angel's soul from the food, but also has a fascinating taste that has never been seen before eating raw meat and blood!","So, with Tyrael as the arrow, hundreds of angels flapped the wings of light together, rushed down from the sky, and rushed towards Roy's position.","Soon, the sweets that these angels turned into were all divided up. When they finally found out that they were gone, the demons turned around and looked at Roy eagerly, hoping that Lord Osiris would give some more rewards.","The angel warrior nodded, turned quickly and flew to the silver city, while Tyrael looked at the hundreds of angel warriors around him and said loudly \"All angel warriors, join me to face the demon king Osiris! He attacked the Diamond Gate!\"","The food scattered from the sky finally landed on the battlefield. The demons on the ground who had raised their heads and screamed got hit on the head by the food. They lowered their heads in confusion and sniffed the food. After smelling the tempting aroma from above, he tentatively swallowed the food into his stomach.","The taste of angel souls is actually not good for demons, but now that angels are made sweets, they are immediately different. There are many demons who have never tasted sweets, so after tasting sweets for the first time, Immediately fell in love with this special taste, in their minds, immediately added a formula angel = sweets!","There are cheeses, biscuits, chocolates, and even Coke, and so on and so forth.","There was a thunder in Tyrael's mind and Roy's words completely woke Tyrael. He looked at the brilliance of the holy feather in his hand with a bitter look, and said, \"Is that so? We don't actually represent justice?\"","There was still some food on the ground that had not been swallowed. The demons on the battlefield who had tasted the taste immediately began to fight. Their actions attracted other demons who had not eaten to follow along, even caused a small disturbance.","These strange abilities of Roy made Tyrael complain a lot. At this time, he had actually used his authority and power. Although he took over the position of the angel of wisdom - Malthael, what he used was what originally belonged to him. The power of justice and authority, under the power of authority, Tyrael's holy feather's brilliance can cut through all evil things, but he can't cut Roy's Frostmourne cursed word.","This is indeed the case. Since Roy's arrival, he has never dealt with the Nephalem people in the Sanctuary. On the island of Xiansai where he lives, people on the island don't even know of his existence. There was a lot of demon gold flowing out of it, but the demon gold just magnified the evil thoughts in the hearts of mortals, and it had nothing to do with Roy himself, and the cause and effect could not actually implicate him.","This is where Tyrael is puzzled. It is said that breaking into the High Heaven is already considered evil... What went wrong in the end!?","This made him a little unbelievable, and he couldn't help roaring \"How can the brilliance of light unable to cut off your evil!?\"","Thousands of fist-sized individuals swooped up behind Tyrael and lay on Tyrael's light wings. The magic of the darkest cold broke out, instantly freezing Tyrael's light wings into black ice crystals.","Tyrael looked at Roy strangely \"To be honest, I doubt whether you are a real demon now!\"","Tyrael was beaten and trembled. Although the damage was not great, it was extremely humiliating. When he roared and swung his sword to cut off these clones, the clones turned into smaller individuals again, calmly. dodged the slash.","Tyrael was stunned when he saw this scene, dumbfounded and didn't know what happened, as were the rest of the angels who were lucky enough to escape.","Tyrael, who was dazzled by anger, rushed towards Roy, holding the brilliance of the holy feather and slashed at Roy with his head covered. The coverage area of ​​the light wings behind him had expanded several times by now, it is clear that all the power has been used.","Tyrael's eyes were tearing apart. Hundreds of angel warriors were gone!? Even the soul has no time to return to the crystal arch!?","Tyrael's Light Wing was frozen. Although he did not fall, his maneuverability was greatly affected. Taking this opportunity, hundreds of thousands of Roy's avatars formed five or six groups, gathered together, and merged into five or six clone. The clones were about one meter tall. The right hands of these clones were all wearing the Red Dragon Emperor Gauntlet. They threw their fists and beat Tyrael's body violently.","Void! That is emptiness! The two archangels banished him together, only to keep him trapped in the void for four hours!?","When the light reappeared in Roy eyes, the eye of the void on Roy's chest slowly closed. This eye of the void is only an auxiliary organ and it can only function in a void environment. The void symbol in the wings behind him The lines of text have also lost their radiance, all of which signify that Roy has returned to the material world.","When Tyrael saw Roy's attack, he knew that the purple lightning was weird, so he shouted \"Be careful\" and took the lead in pulling up, trying to avoid Roy's attack.","Yes, reward, this is a small reward given by Roy to the demons who have been fighting for a long time. He has not used the ability to deform light for a long time. Now it is released in combination with the power of lightning, and the effect is extraordinary. Those strengths were originally far low.

Why do you still have it!?\"","\"Archangel Tyrael, do you regret that you are not a Saint Seiya now?\" Roy said a stalk that does not exist in this world, so he put away the bright soul stone in his hand, and then raised Frostmourne in his hand.","\"Doomsday...

Roy blocked him with a backhand and then fought with Imperius.","Imperius, who came quickly, saw this scene, and he immediately roared loudly because his intuition was not good.","In the ripples of magic power, a huge magic circle with shimmering light was formed, and with the help of this magic circle, Roy's perception also reached the sky!","It can only be said that traditional thinking kills people. Tyrael knows the dark soul stone very well, because there is only one fragment of the world stone, so only one dark soul stone can be made.

The stronger the positive emotions, the stronger the power of the holy light, and the extreme negative emotions will destroy the cornerstone of the holy light in their bodies, then makes the angels lose control of the power of the Holy Light.","The soul stone that imprisoned him before has been temporarily placed in the High Heaven by them, so when he fought with Roy, he was not prepared for Roy's move at all.","There was a loud noise, and the spear of courage full of Imperius' anger and flames slammed into Frostmourne's sword. Imperius roared, pushing Roy's body with all his strength. Roy pushed out a distance of several hundred meters and Roy's feet also cut two deep ravines on the ground.","Therefore, the fall of angels is sometimes not necessarily caused by demons, but caused by their own out of control...","This is not the case. In fact, the real reason is often because the angel's own emotions are out of control! Angels are also intelligent creatures and naturally have a variety of emotions. Although most of the time their emotions are positive and positive, it does not mean that they will not have negative emotions.","This time, the chaotic force directly disintegrated the holy light on Imperius' body, hit his angel body, and the ball of light condensed by the chaotic power pushed Imperius back at a high speed, and finally blasted him directly to the silver city in the distance. above the city walls.","While Roy continued to fight with Imperius, he observed carefully. He found that Imperius was indeed the first person in the High Heaven. Although there were signs of degeneration, the power of the Holy Light was still flowing continuously. His body overflowed and it seemed that he was still a little too hot to complete the last step.","Why do we often hear stories of angels falling in every world? Is it because the angels, who represent goodness and purity, are not as powerful as the demons?","With a flaming flame, it dragged a long tail like a comet, and it fell straight down from the sky. In the desperate eyes of the angels and the fearful eyes of the demons, it flew towards the location of the Diamond Gate. go!","With a scream, Imperius was smashed into the city wall, and with the impact point as the center, the sturdy city wall appeared spider web-like cracks.","With the unwilling roar, Tyrael's soul turned into countless golden rays of light, which was inhaled by the crystal, and his angel body also turned into rays of light and dissipated.","Yes, the gate of diamonds and the city wall have the ability to repair themselves. It is precisely because of this that the ground troops of the demon army have been blocked from the city wall, and there is no progress at all.

The Silver City is very huge. It is not only a city where angels live, but also a powerful fortress. The area here can even be compared to a human metropolis. In comparison, about thirty kilometers away, among the countless spires, there is one of the tallest buildings standing. It is an arch, a crystal arch! It has countless diamond-like crystal faces and under the illumination of the artificial sun of the High Heaven, these diamond crystal faces flash with an indescribably brilliant halo.","After the strong rays of light, what followed was a flame wave that spread to the entire battlefield, and a huge tremor like a tenth-magnitude earthquake under the feet. The speed of the flame wave was so fast that it burned the angels who survived and the ground The huge tremor directly tore the ground beneath the demons' feet, countless cracks spread out, swallowing the unsteady demons one after another.","All the angels in the silver city are concentrated in the city at this moment. They have formed defense lines everywhere to block the pace of the attack of the demon army. For these ordinary angels, Roy's do not do much, and they all handed over to the demon army. Attacking, with the portal kept open, the demons of the Hell of Flames almost came out of their nests, relying on the huge number to continuously attack, crushing the resistance of the angels bit by bit.","But looking at the army of demons pouring into the Silver City, he still forced himself to calm down, because he knew that he had to organize the angels to resist the attack of the army of demons.","During these three days and three nights of attack, the Silver City was almost completely destroyed. The battle between angels and demons caused countless spires to collapse, and the golden sunlight above the Silver City was also blocked by endless dark clouds. The sacred heaven of yore is gone, the echoing sound of divine harmony is gone, only the ruins left behind after the war are whining.","However, because of Roy's strategy, the demons in the Sanctuary were restrained, which led to the main contradiction of the Nephalem people, from demons to angels. The relationship between the two parties during the honeymoon period has been the same since Tyrael disappeared. Deterioration, Imperius' pride also played a role in promoting, so the final result was that this time Roy'sd the team to attack the High Heaven, and no Nephalem appeared to help the angels...","However, Roy's scorned a blind eye to them, turned to look around, and suddenly shouted \"Mephisto! Diablo! Baal! How long are you going to watch!? I dare to show up!? Has the Dark Soul Stone imprisoned you so much that your courage has weakened!?”","However, what he didn't expect was that in just over ten years, the diamond gate shattered again under his nose, and he himself once again tasted the taste of shame.","Imperius did not appear again, but was commanding the angel army at the rear. Roy'sew that he and Itherael should wait for him in front of the crystal arch in the end, so he was not in a hurry, just followed behind the demon army. Move forward slowly, stopping from time to time to rest and rest.","Imperius turned his head and looked in the direction of Roy's. Anger was swallowing his heart and he was so angry that he was about to explode.","Imperius, who flew up again, stared blankly at this scene, watching this familiar scene.","It was such a stupid method that made Diablo consume too much time and also won a chance for the High Heaven. In the end, Tyrael led a group of nephalem elite warriors to stop Diablo together.","Just like countless other angels, they were born and raised within the realms of the High Heaven. It was their home, their sanctuary, and their unwavering devotion. Among them, Imperius held an even deeper attachment, for he was among the first group of angels created. Despite repeated failures that chipped away at his pride and self-esteem, fueling his growing anger, as long as the High Heaven remained standing, his unwavering devotion would endure, unbroken and resolute...","Maybe they wanted to save something, but it was too late. The gate of diamonds disintegrated from top to bottom with a huge explosion, and thousands of tons of boulders kept falling down like rain. Completely collapsed in a whimper.","Mixed in the flame wave and the big earthquake, there is also a very crisp, huge sound like glass shattering.","Not long ago, the Diamond Gate was shattered once, that time by Diablo, when he escaped from the Dark Soul Stone, he gathered the power of the Seven Demons, defeated Imperius and destroyed it. The Diamond Gate, that time, was Imperius' first taste of the shame of failure.","Of course Roy's also knew this, but that didn't stop him from attacking the High Heaven.","Of course, this is not an easy task. Even if there are no countless angels to block it, the super-strong degree of the crystal arch itself is also an important factor that makes it difficult to destroy. The last time Diablo rushed into the high It's a heaven, and in the end, there is no way to destroy the crystal arch, and can only choose the stupidest way: use the power of darkness to corrupt it.","Roy walked towards the opening of the Diamond Gate and entered the Silver City with the army of demons. Countless demons carefully surrounded their king. After entering the Silver City, they spread out excitedly in all directions. Now the entire Silver City Among them, the explosion of magical flames could be seen everywhere, the roar of angels and the screams of demons, the sound of a large number of weapons colliding, and the black smoke pillars burning in the city, all heralded the intensification of this war.","So he glanced at Roy's angrily, turned around and rushed into the Silver City.","That was the sound of the Diamond Gate. The Diamond Gate, which was originally standing tall, was so small when faced with Roy's two-kilometer-diameter meteorite. Under the huge impact force, the Diamond Gate shatter. It didn't resist for a second and was completely crushed.","The azure crystal adorning the pinnacle of the Diamond Gate shattered into countless fragments, scattering in all directions. The sturdy stone pillars that held the crystal on either side cracked at their core, causing them to crumble and collapse. Simultaneously, the meteorite itself met a similar fate, succumbing to the immense force and splitting into two halves. The remaining portion, accompanied by a deluge of blazing debris, continued its tumultuous descent, crashing mercilessly into the heart of the Silver City.","The Diamond Gate shattered, and a huge gap appeared on the city wall. The demons who also reacted, shouted excitedly. While they praised the name of the Demon King Osiris, they rushed towards the gap like a tide. The sporadic angels wanted to intercept them, but they were quickly engulfed by the waves of demons, without even turning over the water.","The Doomsday Judgment, which fell from the sky, smashed the diamond gate, and the strong light that erupted after the collision between the two drowned the entire battlefield like an ocean. The angels and demons near the city gate were screaming in this light... turned to ashes.","The light is so dazzling!","The power of the demons also suffered heavy losses. In the end, only hundreds of elite demons who survived the war followed Roy's the crystal arch, and here, Imperius and Itherael brought the last A group of angels are blocking here, and their bodies have traces of war. The golden archangel armor is covered with blood marks, and there are traces left by various weapons on it, which looks very dilapidated.","The reason is that the crystal arch, which is a real sacred object, is the representative of the creator's power, and Roy's may not be able to destroy it.","There is no doubt that this is a catastrophe in the High Heaven. All the angels who have witnessed this scene can only watch it blankly, unable to stop it. When the last half of the meteorite hits the silver city, it set off a huge explosion in the city. After the explosion and fire, they finally reacted and rushed towards the Silver City like crazy.","These things were all told by Mephisto to Roy's little by little during the follow-up contact with Roy'sn fact, although the Seven Demon Kings in the Hell of Flames knew about Roy's plan to attack the High Heaven, they also expressed their support, but they were actually gurgling deep down in their hearts as to whether Roy's could really enter a High Heaven.","This crystal arch is the legendary building formed by the pillars of the creation God Anu. It is the symbol of the entire High Heaven. It can be said that only by completely destroying the crystal arch can it represent the fall of the High Heaven.","This halo almost illuminated the entire Silver City, and the dazzling picture was intertwined with the harmonious and sacred timbre reverberating in the Silver City, interpreting what it means to be [Heaven]!","This time to attack the High Heaven, Imperius hope that the Archangel Auriel will be brought into the void by him, and the justice Archangel Tyrael will be imprisoned in the light soul stone again. The entire High Heaven is now left with Imperius and Itherael is only and Itherael is not very good at fighting. It can be said that if the High Heaven wants to make a comeback, unless the Nephalem suddenly helps them, there were no hope.","This time, Roy's demon army try attack the High Heaven, which also caused the same effect as when Diablo attacked the High Heaven last time, but this does not mean that he is really better than Diablo who gathered the power of the seven demon kings. Roy is stronger, but because the strategy he planned from the beginning has taken effect.","This war finally lasted for three days and three nights. During this period, Roy'ss also attacked by countless angel troops, but most of these attacks were blocked by the demons who surrounded him. Now Roy's is the representative of the flaming hell.

The problem, the crystal arch will be handed over to you!\"","\"Shards of the World Stone...\" Imperius finally understood the reason why the power of the Seven Demon Kings was recovering faster than the High Heaven had estimated, and he was instantly annoyed.","\"Shut up!\" Imperius raised his spear of courage and pointed at Diablo and shouted angrily, \"The High Heaven was able to thwart your conspiracy last time, and it will do the same this time!\"","\"Since everyone is here, then it's time to do something!\" Roy said to the three old guys \"You fought with the High Heaven for so long, I believe that you don't want to do nothing now, the High Heaven just gone?\"","\"That's right!\" Baal nodded with a smirk, \"From now on, the Hell of Flames will be the Four Demon Gods!\"","\"Uh...\" The Big Three then remembered that the leader of this war was still on the scene, Mephisto's ugly face showed a grin, and said to Roy \"Sorry, Osiris, my brother, we were so excited to meet our old rivals...I think, this is the first time you've met Diablo and Ball?\"","\"what-!\"","\"You can't be wrong!\" Roy looked at the three high-ranking demons, shook his head and said, \"But I don't blame you, because of yourself don't know when you were 'seed'!\"","An unobstructed path emerged, and Roy soared straight into the corridor leading to the main hall of the Crystal Arch. Imperius and Itherael attempted to stop him, but their efforts were in vain, leaving them only able to roar in frustration as they helplessly watched Roy. Gradually, Roy's figure vanished at the end of the promenade...","As for how Roy discovered them, it is actually very simple. It is not based on any special perception, but Roy firmly believes that at the last moment of capturing the High Heaven, as the one who fought the eternal battle with the High Heaven for so long It is impossible for the Seven Devils of Hell to miss this moment.","As for Mephisto Diablo and Baal, they smirked and went straight to Imperius and Itherael!","As he spoke, he lowered his head and looked at the circle of demons surrounding him. Then he waved his hand and the three high-ranking demons were twisted out by his psychic force. The three high-ranking demons were terrified. The ground floated in mid-air, struggling constantly, and said, \"Your Majesty Osiris, you... you are mistaken?\"","As soon as he appeared, Mephisto let out a satisfied sigh, then looked at Roy and said, \"I didn't expect that I would stand on the ground of High Heaven again. This feeling is really wonderful, what do you think?\" Osiris?\"","Hearing Mephisto's words, Diablo and Ball both turned their heads and looked at Roy. At this moment, Roy was not in the form of a misty body, but a normal body height of more than three meters, which caused Diablo and Ball to look down at Roy. They are taller than him, when they looked at Roy, they couldn't help but feel uncomfortable.","Hearing Roy's shout, Imperius and Itherael were suddenly shocked, and immediately spread their perceptions, wanting to see if it was Mephisto and the others who had arrived.","Hearing Roy's words, Mephisto and the others were actually a little embarrassed. To be honest, not only Roy was guarding them, but they were also secretly guarding against Roy, although Roy was found by Mephisto. Foreign aid, but how long has Roy been in this world?

In this case, how can they trust Roy?","However, in their perception, they did not find any trace of Mephisto.","However, the powerful power pervading Roy cannot be faked, so Diablo and Ball did not dare to despise Roy, Diablo nodded to Roy and said, \"Osiris, you did a great job, Starting from today, all the worlds here will sing your reputation of conquering the High Heaven, I think you can consider adding the title of 'World Destroyer' to yourself...\"","I wanted to ask how Roy found them, but it was not easy to ask, because as soon as these words came out, I felt that the momentum was weaker than Roy, so the three old demons tacitly did not mention this at all. A crop.","In fact, he just shouted that out with the attitude of giving it a try, and after shouting, he was keenly aware that among the demons, there were three demons who shouted at him differently from other demons. behavioral attitude...","In just a moment, Mephisto - the king of hatred, Diablo - the king of fear, and Baal - the king of destruction appear in high-heave. The three giants headed by the Seven Demon Kings of Hell have appeared in the High Heaven.","Of these three new giant demons, one of which was seen by Roy in the Frozen Throne, Mephisto's clone is the same, and among the other two, one is a human-shaped upright demon, and the epidermis of his body is It is a hard bone armor, with a blood red background in the black, a pair of giant pincer-shaped demon horns on the head, and a pair of demon horns also wrapped around the cheeks, and behind him, there are several There were many sharp bone spurs, and the bone spurs went down along the vertebrae and spread all the way to the iron whip-like tail, which looked very hideous.","Roy didn't speak either, but just waited quietly.

On its head, three tentacle-like demon horns are lined up side by side, and they dance in the wind. This is the first time Roy has seen this kind of devil's horn that is not hard. That said, it's quite distinctive, and it's an iconic appearance.","The relationship between the Demon Kings has never been peaceful. Although the Seven Demon Kings have recovered more than expected, most of the time, they can only act as clones, and such clones are not only lacking in strength, but also because they need to be separated. Because of the part of the soul, there is a natural disadvantage.

At this moment, Roy finally spoke up and said, \"Why don't I go?\"","Their demon's heart was torn apart and the dark power poured out to hold the three upper-level demons to pieces, and then the dark power began to reshape their bodies. Countless granulation grew from their bodies, wrapping them into wriggling cocoons.

This truth may soon be realized by Mephisto and the others, but currently, as a result of this incident, Roy's momentum has been significantly suppressed, affecting all three of them.","Until the end, Roy sighed and said again \"Come out, don't hide!\"","Until this time, they don't want to appear anymore...","Whether it is Diablo, Baal or Mephisto, these three giants are all old demons who have lived for an unknown period of time. Their words and praise are full of the gratified expressions of the old seniors looking at the new juniors, but in reality Roy didn't know what his Senior was thinking... Roy knew this very well, so he didn't take their words to heart at all, but instead spoke up slightly sarcastically \"I said you three old guys, I found three secretly. I'm a substitute, but I don't take the initiative to show up, if I hadn't found you, you would have wanted to just watch me fight until the last moment, right?\"","Yes, the demon kings planted the seeds of parasitic souls on these three high-ranking demons.

If it's a hallucination, why didn't I wake up with the stimulation?\"","\"Is the Star Soul Titan so awesome?\" Roy was also a little confused, he understood, which means that if there is a correct language in line with the rules of the world in what he said, then Trag'Oul get information about this Part of the 'knowledge' of world rules.","\"No, there is only truth!\" Trag'Oul said \"If you want to talk nonsense, then don't play this kind of cleverness!\"","\"Talent!\" Trag'Oul said simply \"This is the talent of the Star Soul Titan! We can perceive the 'truth'!\"","\"Trag'Oul\" Roy shouted loudly, \"You, who are in the cradle, know the universe only from your imagination, right?\"","\"Welcome to my dreamland, Osiris, the Demon King!\"","\"Well, although I don't know what method you used to pull me into your dream, what are you going to do next?\" Roy asked curiously, \"Are you attacking me?\"","\"What is this situation?\" Roy furrowed his brow and pondered, \"Considering the previous event where the sun was pulled away, could it be that in this dream, all forms of power beyond Trag'Oul's understanding are rendered impossible to manifest?\"","\"You're right!\" Trag'Oul is voice sounded and at the same time, the shining dragon-shaped constellation in the distance also emitted light. A huge dragon-shaped phantom began to appear based on the constellation. The bodies that spread tens of thousands of kilometers are twisted and entangled together, forming a wriggling picture.","A strange-looking dragon head slowly lifted up, covered by countless tentacles, so that people couldn't see Trag'Oul's appearance at all. Only his pair of eyes hidden in the tentacles began to shine.","After considering it for a moment, Roy braced himself for another round of Trag'Oul's attack. Then, he suddenly addressed Trag'Oul, saying, \"You know, the light of a star often takes a significant amount of time to reach a planet due to the vast distances between them and the fixed speed of light.\"","After hearing Roy's words, Trag'Oul didn't say anything, but in the next second, the huge sun was pulled away by a lot. It seemed that Trag'Oul was correcting his mistakes in time, or in other words, he was adjusting his right attitude. Cognition outside the world...","After Roy figured this out, he only felt an unprecedented headache. Star Soul Titans are all powerful perverts. Roy was already mentally prepared, but he never thought it would be like this.","After the last test for a while, Roy found that it was pure elemental power that could still be used!","After understanding this, Roy began to think about how to break the game...","All the cognition of truth, if known by Trag'Oul, will make his power stronger and make his more difficult to deal with, but if he doesn't tell his knowledge, Roy can only be in his deformity. Under the information, using the same kind of deformed knowledge to fight Trag'Oul is like a paradox...","Angels and demons, even if they are combined with each other, are difficult to give birth to offspring. This has long been proved in other worlds. In order to create offspring, Inarius and Lilith must have made relevant modifications, which led to them being able to have children, also the next child. Not only them, but also the angels and demons who hid together in the world of Sanctuary, were also united under this rule to give birth to offspring.","As soon as the words left his mouth, the starlight spears launched by Trag'Oul came to a sudden halt!","But obviously, as Roy's opponent, Trag'Oul isn't explain anything for him. In those movies, the villain is beeping at the protagonist and showing off his ability in general, it will not happen in real life. Once again, countless condensed starlight spears and shot at Roy from a distance. Every time he attacked, he pierced countless holes in Roy's demon body, causing him severe pain, but these injuries Always recover slowly.","But Roy also saw that Trag'Oul had a judgment on his own strength. He might feel that he was not Roy's opponent, so he did not seek to fight Roy at close range. Even Roy's injury just now The ability to recover is only based on his judgment and cognition of Roy.","He couldn't use his power just now, what's going on?","He thinks that he may not be as powerful as Roy, so the Starlight Spear's attack on Roy is not fatal. At the same time, he also knows that demons have amazing recovery capabilities, so Roy's physical injuries can also be recovered, but for this This kind of resilience, Trag'Oul may not have a clear understanding, so it seems much slower.","He tried to condense a fireball, a pure elemental fireball, and then smashed it to where Trag'Oul is. As a result, he saw that the fireball was flying forward, but he wanted to fly to where Trag'Oul is. It can be said that It's a long way off, because in the sentence just now, after Trag'Oul recognized the concepts of 'light speed' and 'planet distance', it means that its entire dream has been changed. This change is not only for Trag'Oul, It is also effective for Roy. The distance between Trag'Oul and Roy is too far, and the Starlight Spear cannot shoot at Roy's position in a short time, so in the same way, any attack from Roy should not hit Trag'Oul. Oh!","In this starry sky, Roy looked so small, and when he was looking around, Trag'Oul is voice sounded again.","Is this a good thing for Roy? No, not so!","It is precisely because of such strange rules that Trag'Oul is the star-soul titan, difficult to mature. The power of the star-soul titan comes from knowledge and truth. They become powerful through cognition of the world and knowledge. This kind of rule adjustment obviously affected Trag'Oul is growth.","Just after such a delay, the spear of starlight that was shot quickly pierced through Roy's body!","Moreover, this revised rule can continue to be adjusted. In order to suppress the power of the Nephalem, Inarius adjusted the frequency of the World Stone and the Nephalem became possible.","Obviously, Trag'Oul should belong to a certain \"deformed child\"! Because he is a star-soul titan born in an artificial world, the star-soul titan born in this way is definitely different from other normal star-soul titan! This is because the rules of the man-made world are different from those of the natural world!","Roy didn't sit still. He tried to switch to other powers, trying to block Trag'Oul is attack, but without exception, he failed. All his elemental powers that had undergone mutation could not be used here.","Roy frowned and found that he couldn't dodge such a large-scale attack at all, so he could only condense a black ice wall in front of him, intending to block the attacks of these star spears, but when he tried to use his magic power to condense the ice wall, Roy found that I couldn't make it at all!","Roy gestured as he spoke. He pointed to the huge sun next to him and the planet under his feet and said, \"If you can see such a huge sun, it means that the planet's position is very close to the sun. If this is the case, this planet It has already burned into a big fireball... It seems that you have not really left the planet and observed it outside the world, otherwise, you would not have made such a mistake!\"","Roy said that it seems that Trag'Oul is the star soul titan, is not fully mature.","Roy thought to himself that there must be some strange rules in Trag'Oul is strange dream.","Roy was stunned when he heard it and then said funnily \"Ha, so, you are actually acquiring 'knowledge' from me? Then how do you judge that this 'knowledge' is correct?\"","The children of Inarius and Lilith, as well as the children of other angels and demons combined, and these offspring combined with each other. This is the reason why the Nephalems truly become a race.","The intense pain struck, making Roy's face twisted. He looked at his body and found that the dense holes in his body were slowly recovering.","The next second, countless stars in the distance turned into sharp spears and shot at Roy densely.","The power of the Star Soul Titan originates from the very fabric of the world, and in the case of Sanctuary, it was shaped and influenced by Inarius and Lilith through the Worldstone. It is likely that they altered the fundamental rules regarding Sanctuary, allowing for various phenomena to exist, such as the presence of numerous Nephalem beings.","This is his dream and everything Roy sees here comes from Trag'Oul is cognition...","To be more precise, they didn't completely stop but instead slowed down significantly. They continued their trajectory from Trag'Oul's position in the distance, but their progress towards Roy's body was far from imminent.","Trag'Oul didn't deny it either, saying, \"Yes, in this dream, everything beyond my cognition cannot be manifested, but in the same way, if you say something, it can also change my cognition!\"","Unless Trag'Oul make the initiative to bring the distance closer...","With this voice, among the distant stars, hundreds of bright stars can be seen shining at the same time. If these shining stars are connected with each other by lines, you will find that they form a constellation, a huge constellation, a constellation circling like a long dragon!","Witnessing this phenomenon, Roy was taken aback and finally grasped the truth."]},{"l":"Change Note","p":["Name Changes","Luo Yin, Luo Yinxin -> Roy","Tagao -> Trag'Oul","Trag'Oul in this chapter got refere as \"She\", but according to Diablo Wiki, Diablo gender is Male.

Roy frowned and glanced at the violent sun, fluttered his wings and flew away from the place, then move towards the distant sun. Roy flew away to distance stars, intending to find the hidden world of the true Sanctuary.","As for why the land shape of the planet under him feet deviates from the world map of Sanctuary, it is better to understand. As a guardian who has existed for an unknown number of years, he must have seen the movement and change of geological plates. Since he 'knows' that the shape of the land can be changed, it is not difficult at all to make some changes to deceive Roy!","Bowing his head, Roy looked at the planet under his feet. This planet was under his feet from the moment Roy was pulled into the dream, but it was not until he thought of the answer at this time that Roy thought of paying attention to it.","But before that, Roy had never seen Trag'Oul at all, and only knew of him existence. It was impossible for two complete strangers to achieve resonance in the frequency of their souls under normal circumstances.","But Roy is not such a devil. In fact, it is easy to see through this scam, as long as you think about it based on Trag'Oul's \"cognition\".","But then, Roy was a little puzzled, because he found out that the planet under his feet was not the world of Sanctuary!","Could it be that I thought wrong, that the real Sanctuary world in Trag'Oul's dream was also hidden by it?","During Roy's stay on Xiansai Island, he had seen a lot of books by mortals. Among these books, many of them were maps recorded by explorers walking around the Sanctuary, which were finally put together to form a world of Sanctuary World. The map, however, the shape of the land on the planet, does not have the slightest resemblance to the world of Sanctuary.","Having realized this, Roy understands that waking Trag'Oul up is not a viable option. He consciously avoids dwelling on such thoughts, aware that if Trag'Oul can establish a connection between their spirits and souls, it is possible for Trag'Oul to gain insight into his innermost musings. Any fleeting idea or notion passing through Roy's mind could be deciphered as a fragment of \"knowledge\" by Trag'Oul, potentially leading to complications down the line.","Hence, the first thing that crossed Roy's mind was not to engage in a direct confrontation with Trag'Oul within this dream. Such an approach would be futile and serve no meaningful purpose.","However, after flying a short distance, Roy suddenly stopped! Trag'Oul, has never flown out of the planet where the Sanctuary is located, so how could he know what the shining stars in the starry sky are like?","However, the system is probably not very helpful at this time. Even if Roy creates something through the system, once it exceeds Trag'Oul's understanding, it is estimated that it will not be materialized. After all, this is a dream, an illusory world.","If Roy was really deceived by him and went to the depths of the starry sky to find the real world of sanctuary, he would not be able to find it even if he flew to death. Trag'Oul could completely destroy Roy's soul through a long period of time. Kill it, completely wipe out Roy's soul in this dream, and completely kill Roy!","If the sole purpose is to retaliate and create favorable conditions for oneself by continuously allowing Trag'Oul to accumulate \"knowledge,\" it would only lead to increasing losses.","In this way, the situation became clear. In order to get out of this dream, Roy had to find a way to disconnect this link.","In truth, this is not the first encounter for Roy with a similar form of mental assault. Even when he was weak, he faced phantoms that targeted the mind. However, the extent to which Trag'Oul's influence can affect the soul is unparalleled. As a demon king, Roy possesses immense power within his spirit and soul, rendering him largely immune to conventional mental attacks. Yet, Trag'Oul's ability still managed to take effect, suggesting that this connection operates on an unconventional level.","It seems that it is only the limit temperature of ordinary flame magic. It is amazing that it can reach the temperature of hellfire...","No wonder this guy shows his posture in the form of a constellation in the starry sky. The purpose is to confuse people and make Roy mistakenly think that this starry sky is a real star!","Ok, Roy almost fell for this guy trick! Roy grinned, he understood that planet under his feet was actually the real Sanctuary world. Only by being familiar with the Sanctuary world could Trag'Oul create such a real planet!","Raising his head, Roy looked at the illusory figure in the shape of a dragon in the distance, and said with a savage smile: \"Trag'Oul, don't let me catch you, once I catch you, I swear to take your star soul Titan. Take out the soul and feed it to my dragon!\"","Recalling some relevant records in the history books, the artificial world of Sanctuary is a world similar to an eggshell. It was originally hidden by Inarius and Lilith with the power of the world stone, like a purgatory space mixed with it. It's like a transparent egg in the depths... Thinking back on these records, Roy also thinks that he has made a mistake. The planet under his feet not only has a different land shape, but also doesn't seem to be in a special state of being hidden.","Roy endured the burning pain. Taking advantage of the gap between the fire waves, his wings flew towards the planet under his feet. He wanted to verify it carefully. This flight made Roy realize that his guess was correct. , The real universe has no atmosphere, so the action of flapping wings is impossible to achieve, but in Trag'Oul's dream, it still allows him to move and get close to the planet under his feet.","Roy frowned and observed the planet again for a while and found that there is indeed a big difference. It does not seem to be the planet where the world of Sanctuary is located.","Roy has confirmed one thing, that is, in this dream, Trag'Oul has a natural advantage.","Roy just defended without saying a word. His tolerance for flames is much better now. Such a temperature can't cause him too much damage, so he just kept looking around while defending in this dream space.","Roy let these high-temperature flames burn himself, but he didn't fight back. He just wrapped his wings around his body to shrink and defense, because he realized that Trag'Oul had no idea how high the temperature of the sun was. Concept, if it is a real sun, the high temperature of tens of millions of degrees can instantly burn Roy to fly ashes, but the fire wave set off by the sun at this moment is only a few thousand degrees, probably...","Roy raised his hand and looked at his demon claws. Although it was very real, Roy knew very well that it was probably just a 'spiritual body'. If intelligent creatures were familiar with their own bodies, even their souls state will unconsciously maintain the appearance of his body. Since Trag'Oul has pulled himself into him dream, it means that he has connected his soul or spirit in some way, and he has never heard of it. What kind of ability can pull the physical body into the dream together, Roy's original body should still be in the silver tower.","Roy realized that this boundless starry sky is actually just the starry sky that Trag'Oul guy observed in the world of Sanctuary, but since he was unable to go to the starry sky, these starry sky in the dream were also the same. It's really just the starry sky, or in other words, it's just some background textures! Even if Roy could really fly to the positions of those stars, he wouldn't be able to see any planets exist!","Roy, who understood it, think that Trag'Oul was very dangerous. he didn't expect Trag'Oul to be very cunning. he might also know that he could guess the problem of the soul link node, so he deliberately made a black-out scam to let Roy appeared in the dream, he was near the real link node. If Roy was the kind of reckless devil who was simple-minded and only believed in power, this strategy might have really succeeded.","Roy's mind is unusually calm now. He guessed that if it is a connection on the soul, then this connection must have a special node. This node is the frequency between Roy's soul and Trag'Oul's soul frequency. The real reason to hit the line.","The reason why Roy assume this to be the link between spirit and soul is because Roy found that he could still open the system interface in his mind here and the system was originally attached to his soul.","Thinking about it this way, the answer is actually ready to come out, it should be a place of sanctuary!","This is probably the reason why he pulled Roy into his dream. Under such dream conditions, Roy was still confused about how to attack Trag'Oul and caused damage to him. It can be said that the counterattack ability is very limited.","This is troublesome. With so many stars in the starry sky, which one is the real Sanctuary World?","This should still involve a cognitive problem. Trag'Oul has not really been close to the sun. His understanding of the sun's light and heat is biased. It is estimated that although he also knows that the sun has a high temperature, it is limited to the flame magic. In terms of temperature, the temperature of flame magic is used as a reference.","Unless...unless there is something, or cognition, that both Royin and Trag'Oul know about, and then use this as a node, Trag'Oul's soul can connect with Roy's soul...","When seeing Roy approaching the planet, Trag'Oul didn't show any anxiety, still attacked Roy unhurriedly, and continued to weaken Roy by creating pain.","While Roy was thinking, Trag'Oul did not stop attacking Roy. When he understood the knowledge of light speed and cosmic space, he stopped attacking Roy with the starlight spear, but instead controlled what next to him.

After a few minutes of delay, Roy destroyed the four guardian angels.","As for Trag'Oul echoing in the silver tower before, the whispering voice of the soul had already disappeared at this time. After this time Trag'Oul's plan to trap Roy through a dream failed, he probably did not dare to appeared in front of Roy again.","At this time, Mephisto should have rushed up to tightly entangle Imperius, but when he looked at Diablo and Baal, the three demon kings tacitly ignored Imperius who left, but rushed towards Itherael together.","Because this place is just a dream of Trag'Oul, this planet is naturally impossible to be a real planet. Although Roy has land on it, the land was trampled by Roy the moment he slammed into the ground. !","Before he could finish his words, his entire body had turned into a light spot and dissipated, and his overflowing soul circled and flew towards the crystal dome.","Before, he controlled the flames of the sun and attacked Roy unhurriedly. To put it bluntly, he had a guilty conscience. In order not to let Roy see this guilty conscience, he had to act like he didn't care.","But it was their duty to guard the crystal dome, so they didn't think much about it, and immediately rushed up with their weapons in roar, launching a desperate blow to Roy.","But now, in this intellectual struggle, Roy has won. Roy, who has traveled through several worlds, is not comparable to Trag'Oul, a stay at home dragon, even if he is a star soul titan.","Diablo roared proudly and with the force of the demon's claws, the Scroll of Fate was torn to shreds!","Everyone should be responsible for what they did, even if he was a star soul titan. Since he attacked Roy, he should wait for Roy's revenge.","Given the importance of God Anu's Crest, it is naturally impossible for the crystal dome to have no protection at all. This hall has a gate that is closed by a powerful divine force, and there are the only remaining four elite upper rank angels guarding them. They have been guarding outside the gate, even if the entire High Heaven is in a turbulent fight, they have not gone out to participate in the war.","he almost succeeded and briefly confused Roy, making Roy almost fooled. If he hadn't reacted in time, Roy would really have rushed into the depths of the starry sky.","His so-called ways of balance can only fool those necromancers who believe in his. Without these, his essence is just an immature star-soul titan who has to hide for self-protection.","Hmm... Actually thinking about it, it's not bad to be able to capture a Star Soul Titan, especially since Trag'Oul's soul form is still the form of a long dragon, so Roy think Rafaro will be happy to devour Trag'Oul's soul, which will allow Rafaro's power to grow tremendously, and the \"Sky Dragon of Osiris\" will become even more powerful.","However, it was already too late at that point. The souls of the angels in all of High Heaven were bound to God Anu's Crest, which allowed for their continuous regeneration. However, this arrangement came with its own shortcomings. When Diablo's power contaminated God Anu's Crest, it had a profound impact on the angels of High Heaven, implicating them all.","However, Roy didn't intend to let his go, and squeezed his demon's claw forcefully, a sinister smile appeared on Roy's face.","However, since Roy was not using a dark power, there was no conflict with the divine power. After the collision of the two powers, it did not cause a huge explosion.","If it wasn't for Tyrael, the archangel who cut off his light wings and condensed a mortal body at that time, he will be polluted by Diablo's power. Tyrael then brought a group of Nephalem warriors into the High Heaven to help, afraid that the High Heaven no longer exists.","Imperius's inner anger could no longer be vented. He forced Mephisto back with one move, leaving his opponent and rushing towards the silver tower, wanting to rush and stop Roy.","In fact, the moment Roy stop again, the phantom of Trag'Oul's Dragon Constellation suddenly flickered.","It remind Itherael of the prophecy I saw on the scroll before...","It was only at this moment, after Roy had seen through him, that he realized none of these demon kings were to be taken lightly. Trag'Oul, with his own capability to vanquish demons, intentionally kept his distance from him, rendering him powerless to halt Roy's advances.","It would be fine if Trag'Oul had been hiding and not showing up. Roy actually didn't have much interest in his, an immature star-soul titan, but this guy not only appeared, but also boldly treated himself. That's another story.","It's just that Imperius never thought that these settings he made would take effect after a short interval of ten years...","Itherael was already hard to support Imperius, but this time, under the siege of the three demon kings, there were frequent flaws. Soon, Mephisto found an opportunity and shredded Itherael left wing directly, while Baal shredded The light wing on his right, and Diablo grabbed Itherael Scroll of Fate!","Mephisto and the others watched this scene, but they didn't capture the soul of Itherael. The three old guys looked at each other, nodded, turned around and walked back, three scarlet portals suddenly appeared Appeared, teleported them back to the Hell of Flames.","Not only was the planet being torn apart, but the entire dream space was shaking violently. Roy looked up and could see that the sun was shaking in the sky. Roy's own body also began to become illusory. Dream space was destroyed, resulting in link instability.","Of course, this is the next step. Trag'Oul is now estimated to be hiding again. In order to find him, Roy has to go back to the world of Sanctuary, and then he will have to snatch Trag'Oul's soul. Roy put some protection, otherwise it will be troublesome to be pulled into a dream again...","Roy originally thought that if he wanted to destroy this link node, he had to find a way to destroy the planet, but what he didn't expect was that the planet was actually too fragile, just as Roy had guessed, this planet is where his soul docked with Trag'Oul. When Roy wanted to destroy it, he could easily destroy it without even needing any special power.","Seeing their souls drift in through the gate of the crystal dome, Roy did not stop him. Anyway, he would be able to see God Anu's Crest soon, and by then he would be able to see almost all the angel souls who died in battle.","Subsequently, Imperius became aware of the immense hidden danger posed to the angels. Therefore, during the reconstruction of High Heaven, he took measures to not only isolate the power connection between God Anu's Crest Crystal and the angels but also employed his own formidable divine power. He sealed the Crystal Dome Hall and made it accessible only when necessary. However, due to lingering concerns, a special guardian angel was appointed as an added precaution.","Taking a deep breath, Roy lifted his right hand, unleashing a surge of potent chaotic energy from his palm. The energy transformed into a misty beam of light, aimed at the door sealed by divine power. It carried the same force as Imperius's full strike, essentially putting Roy in a direct confrontation against him.","Taking steps again, Roy continued to move up. It took a while for him to finally arrive at the location of God Anu's Crest Crystal, the so-called Crystal Dome Hall.","The cracked earth spreads in all directions at a fast speed.

What happened to Mephisto and Imperius under the silver tower.","The reason for this is that in the previous attack, Diablo managed to breach the crystal dome using an unknown method, catching them off guard. Imperius and the others were unaware of his presence until Diablo had already begun tampering with God Anu's Crest Crystal, at which point they realized the gravity of the situation.","The sound even spread throughout the entire silver tower. The angels and the demons who were still at war below heard the whine. The demons headed by Mephisto and the three giants showed ecstatic expressions on their faces, while The angels leaded by Imperius were full of anxiety.","The world was collapsing, the dream was cracking, and Trag'Oul knew that the disconnection of the link was inevitable, so he didn't do any useless struggles. When the whole picture in front of Roy's eyes collapsed, he heard Trag'Oul left a sigh, and he didn't know whether he was pity for his powerlessness, or for letting Roy go, maybe both.","They just left Roy and returned to the Hell of Flames. As for whether they trusted Roy, they thought it was no problem for Roy to win the High Heaven, or if they had other plans, only the three of them would know...","Under the contamination of Diablo's dark power, the angel's wings lost their light, and the power of the Holy Light no longer took care of them. At that time, the angels in the entire High Heaven were abolished!","Under the continuous output of Roy's power, the power poured into the gate was finally exhausted, and the two gates finally slowly fell down, making a loud noise like a whimper.","Watching the scroll of fate turned into countless light spots and gradually scattered, Itherael, who was pierced by Mephisto and Baal's claws, did not feel pain, but instead felt sorrow.","When Roy opened his eyes again, he found that he had returned to the silver tower. How long has it been.","When Roy rushed into the planet under his feet, Trag'Oul's entire dream began to shake.","When the end comes, wisdom will be lost, And justice will fall to earth, Bravery burns into rage— And all hope will be swallowed up by despair. At last, death will spread its wings and cover the sun— Fate was torn to shreds forever.","When they saw Roy appearing, the four elite upper rank angles recognized Roy immediately. Of course, they knew that the High Heaven was attacked by the Demon King Osiris this time, but they had been guarding here and lacked contact with the outside world.

At this time, Roy and Imperius were able to confirm that this should be caused by the attenuation of energy in the crystal. The God Anu's Crest Crystal is the cornerstone of the crystal arch, it is its energy that supports the entire magnificent arch. Once this energy disappears, the arch will not be able to support it.","After thinking about it, Roy raised his right hand and a black fog circled in his palm. In this fog, there were countless desolate viruses. They swallowed Roy's magic power and began to multiply rapidly. It increased exponentially. After Roy felt that the number was about the same, he waved his hand gently, and he immediately swayed these desolate viruses out, covering a small area on the crystal.","After three seconds of silence mourning for Imperius's death, Roy turned his head and raised Frostmourne, like throwing a flying knife, Roy threw Frostmourne towards the crystal. When the sword tip hit the crystal, stabbed in like a broken bamboo, the already broken crystal couldn't hold it any longer. The whole crystal exploded in a world-shattering explosion and the intense light spread out from the top of the silver tower, instantly illuminating the entire High Heaven!","As if a new sun appeared in the High Heaven, illuminating the entire sky, and with the appearance of this light, the magnificent crystal arch that stood tall began to collapse...","Before coming to the High Heaven, Roy had seen this word in the books of mortals more than once. However, since ancient times, few mortals can really go to the High Heaven, so for the The description of God Anu's crystal arch all of it almost derived from the imagination of mortals.","But at this moment, in a fiery red light, a figure rushed into the crystal dome, that was Imperius, he rushed into the dome with a roar, and went straight to Roy!","But if Roy is to use his own dark power to corrupt the crystal like Diablo, because it is too slow, it waste too much time. The endless divine power, if this method is used, it can be said that 99% of the dark power is used for consumption, and the real internal corruption is only 1%.","But on the observation deck, the most conspicuous is the crystal of God Anu's Crest. Perhaps it is a visual error caused by light. If you look at the crystal arch from the ground, you will see that the crystal emits a green light, but it is really here. Later, Roy discovered that the crystal was actually golden!","Considering the enormity of such a creature, Roy concluded that no other beings could exist alongside it, except for Titans...","Due to the rapid proliferation, many desolate viruses piled up together, even formed a sticky feeling. As the Creep of the Desolation Virus spreads, the Holy Light power in the crystal is constantly being absorbed. These Holy Light powers did not fight against the dark power, but directly swallowed up. This kind of efficiency can be said to be more than ten times faster.","Especially when looking at the rugged section at the top, it looks more like a molar...","God Anu's Crest, it's not a real crest, but a super crystal whose size is beyond everyone's imagination!","He stared blankly at the expanding crack, then suddenly held his helmet with both hands and let out a heart-piercing howl.","Hearing this sentence, Imperius couldn't bear it any longer. He fell from mid-air to his knees on the platform.","How big is it? Let's just say it's more than three kilometers in height! Not to mention the width, in fact, after arriving at the crystal dome, Roy was able to get a glimpse of its whole picture.","How can it be so fast!? Imperius was startled and wanted to rush over to purify those black mushrooms, but was intercepted by Roy halfway through, making him roar again and again in a hurry.","However, at this time, Roy just turned his back to the crystal. He flashed lightly, and the spear of courage brushed past him. The spear of courage that was shot quickly turned into a streamer and stabbed the crystal.","I just don't know what this titan looks like to have such a vertebra. Roy now thinks that this crystal might just be a tooth of a certain star soul titan, which is more reliable...","I'm afraid that this proud guy will not allow himself to fall, so he just chooses to perish completely...","Imperius and Roy was also stunned, because both of them saw that a crack appeared at the position where the spear of courage was pierced!","Imperius has never been so eager. At this moment, he can no longer care about fighting with Roy, but wants to save the crystal, but Roy has been obstructing him. In the end, Imperius was in a hurry. With a flick of his hand, he shot his spear of courage towards Roy.","Imperius just died like this. Even the soul did not fly to the crystal, but dissipated and decomposed together. Roy watched this scene without saying a word. Roy though Imperius will degenerate into a dark archangel, but I didn't expect it to end like this.","Imperius, consumed by a mix of incompetence and rage, found himself responsible for the very thing he was meant to protect: its destruction. Overwhelmed by negative emotions, he took a final, desperate step. The darkness within him surged, intensifying and conflicting with his original holy light power. A wretched howl escaped his lips as his once radiant wings became engulfed in dark flames. The golden archangel armor on his body strained under tremendous pressure from all sides, producing ominous cracking sounds and violently collapsing inward.","In any case, as long as this crystal is still there, angels will be born continuously. If you want to completely destroy the angels, you must destroy this crystal.","In just over ten seconds, Imperius's entire armor collapsed into a pile of scrap iron, even the elemental body inside the armor was squeezed. The burning black light wings covered it. It landed on this pile of scrap iron and ignited it. With the burning of this black flame, the armor finally turned into fly ash.","Initially, there was a small black spot on the crystal's surface. However, within a minute, the size of the black spot had doubled, and its expansion rate accelerated rapidly. The black spot continued to spread outward, increasing its area at an increasingly rapid pace.","It is no wonder that this place is called the birthplace of angels. The complex mechanism inside the crystal does not look like the function of natural crystal. Even if the crystal is really the remains of the creator God Anu, this function It could not have been there from the beginning. Roy felt that this might be a function added by the angels in the later stage. They just used the characteristics of this crystal.","Not long after the battle, the entire silver tower trembled. At first, Imperius thought it was caused by the battle, but then he realized that something was wrong. He looked down and found that the upper part of the crystal of God Anu's Crest had been destroyed by that A sticky black creep is covered!","Observing the towering height of the crystal, Roy contemplated that if it indeed belonged to a vertebra, the creature associated with it must be at least ten kilometers tall! Imagining a humanoid being of such proportions standing upright on the planet's surface, their head would breach the troposphere!","Of course, perhaps the creator God Anu in this myth and legend is indeed a titan, perhaps even a star soul titan. After all, in many world creation legends, the creator gods are suspected to be titans, such as the two in the world of Ashan. The God of Creation, Asha and Urgash are, so if the God of Creation in this Diablo world is also a Titan, it would be reasonable.","Pulling out Frostmourne, Roy tried to cut a sword on the crystal, but when the sword fell, the crystal was not damaged in the slightest and Roy's sword was shaken and trembling. Roy changed to another method to attack, then found the firmness of this crystal is beyond imagination!","Roy flew up and observed around the crystal for a while, and found that all the divine power was concentrated inside the crystal. When these divine powers were working, a unique humming sound came from the whole crystal.","Roy floated in the air and waited with his arms crossed. He suspected that the reason why the crystal was so strong was because the power of the Holy Light contained in it was too large. After the energy density was reduced, the firmness of the crystal might decrease. Time to destroy.","Roy held his sword and Imperius held held his gun blade, the grinned at him \"What? Are you here to witness the collapse of the crystal arch?\"","Roy somewhat understands why Diablo chose to corrupt this crystal last time, because it is estimated that he can't hurt this crystal.","Roy was filled with a strong urge to express his disbelief. The ancient legend seemed too far-fetched to be true. He couldn't see any resemblance between the crystal and the vertebra of the God of Creation. If it were truly a vertebra, then what kind of creature was God Anu, the creator, to possess such a massive bone?","Standing on the observation deck, you can see some vague scenes below, which are the buildings in the Silver City of High Heaven, but at this height, these buildings appear very small, and occasionally you can see some small black spots Fly over, it's the flying demons and monsters that are ravaging the city.","The crack continued to expand in a clack and soon spread over the entire crystal surface. Even the stickiness of the desolate virus blanket could not prevent the crack from expanding.","The crystal lacks any signs of polishing, giving it a rough appearance on the surface. The upper half of the crystal maintains a solid shape, but the lower half forks and splits into two columns, providing support for the entire crystal. This might explain the bifurcated structure of the crystal arch. However, in Roy's perspective, the crystal doesn't resemble a pillar but rather resembles a tooth with its root.","The reason why he thinks this way is because Roy can perceive the angel souls stored in the crystal. These souls are flowing slowly inside the crystal, and some changes are taking place at the same time. The souls seem to be being merged and reorganized.","The so-called crystal dome is actually just a platform or platform built on the top of the entire crystal. Part of the floor is hollowed out and the God Anu's Crest Crystal has two symmetrical forks from the hollowed out. The ground stretches out and it seems that the platform is inlaid on the crystal. The angels of the High Heaven, in order to set off the grandeur of this crystal dome, even stood several equally tall angels on both sides of the road leading to the viewing platform. Statue, when Roy walked all the way, these angel statues seemed to pay attention to him.","The two began to dance and fight in the crystal dome. Imperius was desperate, so Roy also fought seriously. Every collision between the two brought huge energy shock wave, and these energy waves spread. Going out and impacting the surrounding space, all kinds of solid buildings around it are also constantly cracking.","These desolate viruses, which can rapidly multiply by swallowing energy, fall on the crystal, like a mouse falling into a rice vat. They don't care whether the energy in the crystal is the power of holy light or not. For the desolate virus, it is all It is energy that can be swallowed, so in the blink of an eye, the Desolation Virus began to multiply desperately.","Under Roy's gaze, Imperius, who was full of anger and had nowhere to express his remorse, the huge fiery red wing behind him began to change little by little, turning into pitch black like ink...","What does God Anu's Crest look like?","While the crystal may not resemble a vertebra, its presence exudes an immensely potent divine energy. The golden light emitted by the crystal is not blinding but rather restrained, yet it is apparent that even lower-ranked demons would find it extremely challenging to approach the crystal closely.","With a loud bang, Solarion's spear blade slashed at Frostmourne!"]},{"l":"Change Notes","p":["Name Changes","Barren viruses -> Desolate virus","Roy got this virus during promotion to high-rank demon at Darksiders World"]},{"l":"RV Notes","p":["Really sad Imperius died and all of the Archangel end."]}],[{"i":"535-in-the-name-of-despair","l":"535: In the name of despair","p":["\"King of Despair - Osiris!\"","\"My name is Osiris!

If he had known that he would have left more angels, the more angels who witnessed the collapse of the crystal arch, the more desperate souls he might get.","After swallowing the despairing souls of these angels, the bottom-level information of the world that Roy saw through his authority became clearer, and the \"strings\" that could be plucked in the past also became thicker. These are the power of his authority.","After the soul flew into Roy's palm, Roy discovered that these sacred angel souls, which were supposed to be golden, actually revealed a gray color, and the angel faces that flashed from time to time in the soul were also a numb expression.","After the violent burst of light, the disintegration of the crystal arch followed, huge spider web-like cracks spread all over the surface of the tower crushed into stones of various sizes from hundreds of catties to hundreds of tons collapsed. It fell from a height of three kilometers and hit the ground with an astonishing loud noise and tremor.","Afterwards, the demons looked at Roy who was slowly descend in the sky with frantic eyes. They shouted the name of Osiris, the king of demons, and squatted on the ground, paying Osiris the highest tribute to the demons.","Almost at the moment of contact with these souls, Roy noticed an extreme negative emotion from these souls!","Among those witnessing the cataclysmic event, there were beings whose expressions mirrored that of the angels. These beings were the demons. Despite their incessant clamor for the downfall of the high heavens, they had never truly comprehended the spectacle that would unfold when their desired destruction became a reality. As they beheld the crumbling of the Crystal Arch, the very symbol of the high heavens, confusion gripped them. Just like the angels, they stood in stunned silence, unable to fathom the unfolding events before their eyes.","Angels will have this kind of emotion, but Roy can understand that the destruction of the crystal arch means that the High Heaven has completely fallen, and the remaining angels are unable to save, so that they commit suicide in despair. These dying emotions are completely inherited by the soul, and finally Formed this [desperate soul].","As a result, the collapse of the crystal arch lasted for more than an hour. Everyone in the High Heaven watched it for more than an hour. The thrilling scene had made them forget that they were still fighting.","As for the surviving angels, there is only endless sadness left at this moment. They looked at Roy with hatred, but none of the angels launched a vengeance charge against Roy, because they all knew that the High Heaven was over.","As Roy's voice fell, countless demons gathered in the High Heaven made a frantic roar. They were venting their excitement that was about to get out of control. After the roar, they shouted loudly in demon language. Roy's real name.","As the immense tremors subsided, the demons snapped out of their stupor. Once they comprehended the magnitude of the event that had transpired, a unified roar of exhilaration erupted from their ranks.","At this moment, to the demons, the name of Osiris is even greater than the Seven Deadly Sins...","But in such a large-scale war, many situations are out of control, so Roy just regretted it for a while and didn't think about it.","But now, this scene has really appeared. The angels thought they had seen an illusion and couldn't believe it.","But now, with the clarity of the meaning of power, Roy finally knows what his power can do.","He looked at the large number of demons who were all around him, and saw that they were all crawling around the ruins under his feet, waiting for him to speak, so he floated up slightly, showing his misty body, loudly roaring filial piety","He lowered his head and looked at the rock fragment of a crystal arch in the ruins. This rock fragment was very huge, weighing thousands of tons. However, Roy only slightly hooked his fingertips at it and saw Countless cracks suddenly appeared in this huge rock fragment.","However, since God Anu's Crest Crystal had collapsed, after these angels committed suicide, their souls could not find a place to go, so they could only keep hovering near the corpse.","However, these are not what Roy cares about. What he cares about is that these desperate souls are actually resonating with his Mobius Mark!","In every corner of the High Heaven, there were still some surviving angels who did not give up their resistance and still fighting against demons, but after the strong light that erupted just now, they all involuntarily looked up in the direction of the crystal arch. They could only stare at the collapsed scene in stunned silence.","In particular, it is even more rare when the soul that produces this kind of emotion is still an angel soul.","In the end, there were more than 1,400 souls of despair collected by Roy, which was also the last number of surviving angels. After they witnessed the collapse of the crystal arch, their souls all turned into souls of despair.","Incomparable despair grew in the hearts of the angels. They pulled out their weapons, pierced them into their chests, and chose to commit suicide to be buried with the High Heaven.","It is worth mentioning that the negative emotions that can be used by different demon kings are different and the increase of authority and power caused by these negative emotions is also different. Negative emotions that are easy to obtain will increase the authority less, and it is difficult to obtain them. The negative force of the power will increase the authority even more.","On this day, a name resounded through hell and heaven, through Sanctuary, through the entire Diablo world.","Roy devoured all these despairing souls and not storing it in the system interface as usual.Whenever he devoured a despairing soul, he could feel that his Mobius Mark became stronger.","Roy realized something, so he swallowed these desperate souls without thinking about it. Not only that, he waved again, and more desperate souls left by suicide angels kept moving towards his position.","Roy, who was slowly falling, did not see these suicide angels, but an inexplicable feeling made him turn his head and look at the location of these suicide angels. After thinking about it, he waved, and soul turned into a streamer and flew towards his location.","Since it didn't take long for him to become a demon king, Roy was very unfamiliar with how to use his power in the past, and he didn't know how to strengthen his power, so he still chose to fight without it. In the past fighting methods, more use of magic and chaotic power to fight.","The actual process is like this, it may be a bit complicated to describe, but it is such a process, Roy's authority and power can make any substance enter a state of \"self-destruction\"!","The crystal arch is the belief of all High Heavenly angels. For many angels, the crystal arch has been standing there from the moment they were born. It has stood for thousands of years. In the thinking of the angels, they would never thought it would fall.","The crystal arch, which was more than three kilometers high, finally collapsed and the ruins left behind were more than two hundred meters high, and the smoke and dust it set off filled the area for hundreds of kilometers, it did not disperse for a long time. Because of the massive loss of holy power, all the angles became fragile. God Anu's Crest Crystal was blown into countless fragments in the explosion. These fragments were buried in the ruins along with the rubble at the moment. Even so, the black desolate virus attached to these fragments has not yet spread. After disappearing, the energy-loving virus is still greedily absorbing the remaining energy in the debris.","The emotions of desperation that Roy can tap into are rare and elusive among intelligent beings. Such emotions only arise when one is truly pushed to the brink, facing dire circumstances and overwhelming despair. Consequently, acquiring these \"desperate souls\" is no easy feat. They are scarce in number, but their impact on Roy's Mobius Mark and authority is tremendous.","The potency of these souls, laden with the weight of desperation, greatly enhances Roy's abilities and grants him unparalleled strength. Through the connection to these rare souls, Roy taps into their deep reservoirs of anguish and channels them to fuel his own power. It is a symbiotic relationship, as Roy harnesses their desperation to elevate his own capabilities, giving him an edge in the face of formidable challenges.","The whole process didn't seem like a big deal, but only Roy knew that he had actually plucked a \"string\" just now, injecting the power of \"desperation\" into this rock fragment.","There were even some clever demons who saw Roy's intentions, hugged the desperate souls they found at their location, and rushed towards Roy, intending to dedicate them to Roy.","These shards resembled the flickering life of a dying patient, their dark light a desperate attempt to cling to existence. Gradually, their feeble struggle waned until every trace of energy was depleted, leaving them enveloped in complete darkness. This marked the dissipation of the High Heaven's last remnants of light.","This feeling is called \"despair\"!","This is a very powerful power. In theory, his power is very difficult to decipher. Of course, although the use of this power does not consume any magic power, it needs to consume a lot of Mobius Mark power. With Roy's current Mobius Mark state , it cannot be used frequently and continuously, and the self-destruction of matter can only be done at the macroscopic level, and it cannot be done at the molecular atomic level for the time being.","This is the power of authority that belongs solely to the demons, epitomizing their inherent traits and negative emotions. Mephisto embodies hatred, Diablo instills fear, Baal unleashes destruction, Belial weaves webs of lies and deceit, Asmodeus revels in sin, Duriel inflicts pain, and Andariel inflicts torment. These distinct emotions, borne by sentient beings in their own unique ways, serve as fuel for demons to enhance the potency of their Mobius Mark and authority.","This requires Roy to take more special [Desperate Soul] to improve...","This time, the entire High Heaven, all kinds of roars of demons resounded, celebrating the victory!","Thousands of tons of rock shattered into countless tiny fragments in a short period of time. These fragments were further decomposed and turned into countless dusts. In the end, even these dusts disappeared.","With each surge of these emotions, the demons harness their true power and amplify their influence over the realms. It is a twisted symbiosis between darkness and despair, a grim reminder of the malevolent forces lurking within the depths of the demonic realm.","Yes, even inanimate objects devoid of consciousness can be affected by despair! When this emotion takes hold, even rocks and fragments can experience a sense of existential doubt and then undergo a process of desperate disintegration. The very essence of their being seems to question its own existence, leading to a cascading collapse driven by sheer desperation.","Yes, Roy finally figured out what his power is, that is... despair!"]}],[{"i":"chapter-536---550","l":"Chapter 536 - 550"}],[{"i":"536---liliths-return","l":"536 - Lilith's Return","p":["\"But the problem is, if there is a disruption in the High Heaven, it could potentially lead to a demonic invasion of Sanctuary!\" the apprentice exclaimed, his voice filled with anxiety. \"Even if the mages hold animosity towards angels, they must recognize the threat the demons pose to their own existence.

He patiently awaited the arrival of his apprentice, who would soon join him in their shared mission. As the apprentice entered the church, the instructor rose from his seat, his weathered face illuminated by the glow of the holy light emanating from his hammer. It was time for them to embark on their journey together, to continue their training and seek the means to purify their faith from the corruption that had infiltrated it.","The inheritance of the Crusader organization is the inheritance method of \"mentor\" and \"apprentice\". Every qualified Crusader soldier will accept an apprentice. They regard the apprentice as their heir and the mentor will hone the disciple into a weapon of the Holy Light. When the teacher dies, the disciple must inherit the teacher's weapon, shield, name, and the [2] jihad mission that the teacher has not yet completed.","The necromancers give the Crusaders the grave news that the High Heavens had fallen. Osiris, the King of Despair, led an army of demons to defeat the angelic forces and lay waste to the Crystal Arch. Within the ranks of the four archangels, the righteous Archangel Tyrael was once again imprisoned. The Archangel Auriel, the beacon of hope, was reported missing, while the Archangel of Destiny, Itherael, perished in battle. Consumed by anger, the Archangel of Courage, Imperius, succumbed to its wrath. Faced with the dire circumstances, Imperius opted for self-destruction, unwilling to be complicit in the downfall.","The origins of the Crusaders can be traced back to the paladins of the original Zakarum religion. It is believed that many years ago, a leader among the Zakarum paladins became acutely aware of the corruption and depravity Mephisto had infused into their once pure faith. By the time he realized the extent of this corruption, it was already too late. In a desperate attempt to cleanse their beliefs, he handpicked a group of elite warriors who had managed to resist the taint of corruption. Together, they embarked on a journey to the east, officially labeled as an expedition, but in truth, they were on a covert mission to find a way to purge Mephisto's influence from their faith.","The people startled by the thunder and straightened up from their beds in horror. They wiped the cold sweat on their foreheads, groped their way up, and lit the oil lamps. Witnessing the light of lightning that flashed from time to time. They put their hands on the oil lamps, stopping the gust of wind blow out the flickering lights, they went to the window to close the creaking window.","The priest within the church attempted to reason with the enraged mob, emphasizing their shared faith in the Holy Light rather than angels. Yet, amidst the chaos, the lines blurred for the furious crowd, leading them to assault the priest and drive him away, leaving the poor man wandering, his whereabouts unknown.","The reason why the news of the destruction of the High Heaven was first reported is because the head of the Rathma sect, Trag'Oul, participated in the battle of the High Heaven, although he failed to stop Roy and was unable to save the High Heaven. The fate of falling, but after returning, he immediately thought about what to do next.","The strange celestial phenomenon brought a large-scale rainfall to the world of Sanctuary, and even caused the entire sea level rise a little.","Then, he spread rumors, claiming that there was a lot of gold and silver treasures buried here, in order to attract the robbers and gangsters in the sanctuary to come to seek treasure, he killed these robbers and gangsters, and poured their blood into them continuously in the altar.","There was not even the light of candles in the church, it was pitch black.","This is a dark hall with a huge magic circle engraved on the ground. Three stone pillars stand in an equilateral triangle in the magic circle.

The inhabitants of the Sanctuary world remained oblivious to its fate...","This person is the founder of the Rathma Sect, Mendeln!","This time, everyone was overwhelmed. After realizing it, they look back and find that although angels are also hateful, they are the first target of the devil's attack. Before the High Heaven fell, they has resisted most of the demon invasions, and the impact on Sanctuary is only one-sided.","To establish contact with this coordinate, one must seek the progenitor of all Nephalem, the revered Queen of the Crimson Seas—Lilith, whose essence embodies the very essence of the Nephalem bloodline.","Trag'Oul felt that these nephalems might need a leader, a leader who could bring them together.","Yes, Mendeln is still alive.

Received a memory!\" Lilith regained her strange-colored child hole and an unexpected look flashed across her face.","\"It's nothing, let's move on!\" Of course Lilith wouldn't explain to Mendeln. In fact, the terrifying power that erupted on her body just now was Void Erosion! Lilith was exiled in the void for so long, how could she not be corrupted by the void, but the corruption of the void was restrained by Lilith's special power, if it wasn't for the fact that she appeared when she received the memory just now After a brief absence, otherwise the void power in her body would not easily riot.","\"Mendeln...\" Lilith's index finger slid across his face and the sharp black nails smeared a bloodstain on Mendeln's face, although the bloodstain disappeared quickly, doing so made Lilith's eyes deep With a flash of happiness. She asked with cold words and a charming voice \"My child, speak to me. When you witnessed Inarius banish me to the void, you did not come to my aid. And now, after banishing me from the void, you have summoned me back to rescue you. Should I not feel angered by your actions?\"","\"Oh?\" said Lilith, Mendeln's method of changing the subject was still effective.

Sure enough, a strange demon... So, he brought the eggs of the Red Sea?\"","\"The Mighty Queen The Female Demon King\"","\"What...?\"","\"Yes, My Lady!\" Mendeln replied, head bowed.","A groan emanated from Lilith's throat, accompanied by her captivating voice, causing Mendeln's blood to surge uncontrollably. In an attempt to regain his composure, he hastily bit the tip of his tongue to snap himself out of the trance.","After a while, Lilith finally stopped shaking and became quiet. An invisible force enveloped her body, forcing the deep dark fog back again.","Although Lilith is not Mephisto's real daughter, Lilith does have some abilities that are very similar to Mephisto's, such as the ability to obtain memories from other avatars. Not every Demon King has such abilities.","As Lilith descended to the ground, she delicately unfurled her demonic wings, causing the altar room behind her to tremble violently. The powerful earthquake shook the very foundation of the coordinates where Lilith had been exiled. In a resounding display of her power, Lilith personally brought about the demise of the loathsome structure that had repulsed her, reducing it to rubble and ruin.","At the same time, her [3] Enigmatic Orifice has also changed. The original strange-colored Enigmatic Orifice has now become two golden ones, a terrifying and trembling force that Lily has never seen before. Silk burst out, it was a black mist that was too deep to look directly at, the mist enveloped Lilith's body, making her whole body tremble.","Behind Lilith, a slender tail extends downwards, its length considerable. Devoid of flesh and blood, the tail consists of a chain-like formation crafted from bones. At the tail's end, the tips splay out resembling sharp claws.","But these protected children turned into white-eyed wolves as soon as they turned their heads. Their bloodline gave them an incomparably powerful power, in return they used their power to betray the hand that give them food. This led to Lilith being successfully exiled by Inarius.","Even though Lilith's actions were unintentional, being the world's first succubus, her every unconscious movement possessed an unparalleled allure for male beings. Mendeln was acutely aware of this fact, yet he dared not entertain any illusions or desires whatsoever.","Fortunately, this predicament proved to be temporary. As Lilith's body eventually settled and cooled, the color of her child's hole became fixed. It transformed into a dual-tone combination of black and gold, exhibiting contrasting hues. Additionally, black tears materialized under her eye sockets, while dark lips adorned her pale skin, imparting an enchanting allure. The bony demon's horns, with pronounced veins, took the shape of a devil's crown. The two thickest pairs protruded upwards, held high on either side, while the smaller pair curved downwards like sideburns around her neck.","He knew very well that after being exiled to the void for so many years, Lilith had accumulated countless anger in her heart that needed to be vented. It was completely normal to have such a reaction.","However, before the words fell, a huge force struck, directly smashing Mendeln out and hitting the opposite stone pillar. With a bang, the stone pillar collapsed, Mendeln rolled in the gravel, and bounced on the ground. After he fell several times, he finally stopped far away from where he stood.","However, perhaps it was the blood flowing from the corner of Mendeln's mouth that made Lilith smell her own blood, so she did not attack Mendeln again, but spoke slowly, using a lazy and provocative voice to address Mendeln. Said \"Look up...\"","However, what Mendeln didn't expect was that when the name of Osiris, the king of despair, was mentioned, Lilith suddenly let out a shrill scream, and she suddenly hugged her head, looking in pain.","In the face of Mendeln's earnest call, Lilith didn't speak, she just lowered her head slightly and looked at her former son in front of her.","Lilith made a slight move and a pair of huge demon wings stretched out from her back.","Lilith's resentment is very heavy. In fact, just imagine it. In order to protect the Nephalem in Sanctuary, Lilith even turned against heaven and hell at the same time. She killed all the angels in Sanctuary. and demons, just to protect their children.","Mendeln asked cautiously, \"My Lady, what just happened?\"","Mendeln didn't dare to ask any more questions, he continued to tell what had happened recently, and finally said \"My Lady, the High Heaven has fallen, three archangel has died, the rest is missing or disappeared.

But he didn't dare to do anything, he still walked over to Lilith and knelt in front of her.","Not because he respects Lilith, on the contrary, he is afraid! As a friend and brother who traveled with Uldyssian, Mendeln still remembers the time when Lilith first returned. You must know that although Lilith is the mother of Nephalem, she has no concept of ethics. She even seduced Uldyssian to have descendant with her when she was a succubus.","Now, these unworthy descendants not only have no thought of atonement, but want to ask themselves for help, Lilith doesn't know how they can say this...","She didn't lie, she did receive a memory just now, and this memory came from another clone of hers in another world!","So Mendeln said \"My Lady, this time I guide you to return from the void because of a huge thing happen in Sanctuary, the High Heaven... is gone!\"","So Mendeln told Lilith what Trag'Oul had told him.","The form of the Demon King, pale skin, strangely colored child holes, and eyes that are so cold that one can freeze. Facing the gaze of the Demon Queen, Mendeln also felt a lot of pressure, he knelt down on one knee and lowered his head, Whispered \"My Lady, I welcome your return...\"","The layer of flesh and blood barrier that Lilith passed through when she descended originally formed a huge flesh and blood cloak behind her, but this flesh and blood cloak also turned into blood-red petals, lingering around her body. These blood-red petals In the end, it turned into a baroque-style shirt and wore it on Lilith's body. After wearing this black, dress-like shirt, Lilith looked even more bewitching.","The transformation between void and matter is still going on in her body. Lilith's naked body has a strange reflection on her skin, but the most interesting thing is her cold [2] child holes. I don't know what happened, but the color of Lilith's child hole alternated between black and gold, giving people a very unstable feeling.","This exile spans thousands of years, enduring the desolate realm of the void. Merely a year in such solitude is enough to drive one to madness, let alone thousands of years. Lilith wonders how she managed to endure the relentless passage of time.","This is what Mendeln is afraid of. Once he has any delusions about Lilith, he will be noticed by Lilith, and then it will be bad...","This pair of huge demon wings looked very ferocious, the wing membrane between the wing bones are grayish-white. At the end of the wings, several extremely sharp bone spurs hung down to the ground, very much like a blades.","Undoubtedly, Mendeln was well aware of the cause and effect of the Nephalem's transgressions. However, he had no intention of severing ties with Lilith. When Lilith initially emerged from the void, fueled by her animosity towards Inarius, she sought Uldyssian's support. However, Uldyssian, reluctant to be a pawn in Lilith's schemes, opted to resist. With each side perceiving the situation from different perspectives, both held their own truths, making it difficult to discern a clear path forward.","When Mendeln heard Lilith's words, he was a little puzzled and asked, \"My Lady, have you... have you met Osiris, the King of Despair?

Of course, this gate of hell has been destroyed, Along with the cathedral, and has been reduced to ruins.","[3] Eden, that is, Eden Garden! It is the original place of heaven, the true birthplace of all angels and holy lights, and the ultimate and highest level of heaven. Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, these famous original archangels are stationed in Eden.","[3] However, combined with the origin of the High Heaven, after discussing the Seven Demon Kings, they felt that this thing might be the key to Eden!","After all these are done, the main event finally comes, which is about the distribution of the cake of Sanctuary.","After all, if this key can really open the door of Eden, Roy does not have the courage to attack Eden Paradise. In addition, if the key is to open the door to the birthplace of Star Soul Titan, it is also very dangerous. Let them go if they die, Roy didn't want to get involved.","After crossing the fortress of demons, there is the Plain of Despair. The Plain of Despair belongs to the painful realm of the Flame Hell. It is the area under the control of Andariel, the Queen of Pain. It is filled with poisonous ashes all day long, and even breathing will make people feel pain, and these pains Will make Andariel feel very happy.","After escaping from the dark soul stone, the Seven Demon Kings are still recovering. They need to recover the wounds in their souls and re-condense their powerful bodies. Under such circumstances, their strength has declined. From Roy's attack on High Heaven Judging from the strength they showed at the time, they didn't have much chance of winning against Roy alone. On the contrary, in the Flame Hell, the seven demon kings could join forces to fight against Roy.","All of this unfolded due to a conspiracy planned by the seven demon kings. It all began with the tumultuous Original Sin War, which led to the unfortunate exile of Lilith, one of the creators of Sanctuary, back into the desolate void. In the midst of this chaos, the other creator, Inarius, became a pawn in the power struggle between the forces of Heaven and Hell. In a rather ironic twist, the angels, using Inarius as a bargaining chip, handed him over to the forces of Hell, under the condition that the Hell of Flames conform to the principles of the High Heaven. As a consequence, this meant that the denizens of Flame Hell were forever barred from setting foot in the world of Sanctuary.","As for Roy, he was sitting next to the three dark thrones above.","As soon as you come out of the gate of hell, the first thing you see is the fortress of demons. This is the outermost periphery of the Flame Hell. There are all kinds of demons who are not in the mainstream and those who died in the eternal battle cannot return. The Demon Fortress can be said to be the main place where the Hell of Flames will meet the enemy in the eternal battle. The angel army of the High Heaven has also hit here countless times. In order to prevent the angels from continuing to attack the depths of the Hell of Flame, the demons They have established a large number of defenses here, and all kinds of ferocious and sturdy fortresses with open teeth and claws stand together on the top of the mountain, forming a powerful fortress, which is the origin of the name of the fortress.","But this is actually wrong. The quality of the human souls in the Sanctuary world can be said to be beyond imagination. In addition to the influence of the Nephalem bloodline, this world has suffered too many hardships! Just as Tyrael can see the tenacity and kindness of the mortals born here under the ordeal, the devil can also see the distortion and darkness in the hearts of the mortals here under the ordeal!","Chaos Demon Temple is Diablo's hidden residence. Deep underground is the source of the River of Fire. This is a huge cross-shaped building, similar to a broken cathedral, but the cathedral is surrounded by flames and lava. As time passed, lava and blood scorched the exterior of the Chaos Demon Temple.","Clearly, this arrangement was an agreement, a contract of sorts. The angels, recognizing the immense power of the Nephalem, were wary of the possibility of these extraordinary beings falling into the clutches of the devil. Thus, they devised a way to forge this contract, ensuring that the Nephalem would be shielded from manipulation by the forces of evil.","Either Uldyssian is like a saint, or he is crazy and twisted like Skeleton King Leoric... In short, the mortal souls of this Sanctuary world are very attractive to the Seven Demon Kings.","Even Mephisto can't guess what this key of light is. The only one who might know about it is Imperius, but Imperius has self-destructed and died, so what exactly is this thing? It's hard to tell what it's useful for.","Flame Hell is not a whole piece like High Heaven, but is divided into seven realms. The seven realms of hell are isolated from each other by the void. Each realm is an independent space bubble, which can be reached by portals. Each realm is controlled by a demon king and its environment is also different, but in general everyplace are extremely cruel. The environment here bears a striking resemblance to the abyssal realm, leaving me uncertain whether it existed in this manner from the inception of Flame Hell or if it underwent a gradual transformation by the hands of the Seven Demon Kings.","For Tyrael, Roy has his own use, so no matter how the Seven Demon Kings hint, conditions, or even coercion, Roy has only one attitude... No.","However, due to the existence of the portal, these three places are related to each other in terms of space concept. That is to say, in theory, mortals in the Sanctuary can go to the High Heaven and the flame hell.","However, for the request of the Seven Demon Kings, Roy was just two letter: \"o\"","However, in the thousands of years of history of Sanctuary, the rumors about the High Heaven and the Flame Hell handed down are quite rare, and the description of these rumors is only a general concept.","However, just as the Seven Demon Kings thought, the only person responsible for contacting Eden is Imperius. The place of contact is also in the crystal arch and it is estimated that it is with the Crest of God Anu. Crystal is related, but it is not clear whether this Holy Light key is the key to open the gate of Eden Heaven. It should also be the Star Soul Titan, and it should be a Star Soul Titan with both light and dark powers. Otherwise, it will not correspond to the creation myth of this world.","However, they forgot that demons are the best at exploiting contract loopholes. They were expelled under the pretext of \"rebellion\". The three Mephisto brothers breach the contract with the High Heaven and were able to enter the Sanctuary again. When they corrupted the Zakarum Cult and achieved their goal, there was this huge hell portal in the cathedral.","If the High Heaven bars mortals from entering due to the angels' arrogance and disdain for the mortal realm, then the Flame Hell rejects feeble mortals due to its cruel and harrowing environment.","If the Queen of Pain Andariel enjoys mental pain, then her brother Duriel enjoys physical pain, which is why Duriel is called the King of Torment, his territory The Tormented Land is next to Andariel's territory.","If this gate of hell is still there, you can enter the space where the Flame Hell is located by crossing this portal.","Imagine if Roy went to attack a certain world, with hundreds of thousands of Dante and Virgil behind him, or hundreds of thousands of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, what would it be like?","In fact, according to the level of Demon King, ordinary souls and the like, Mephisto and the others have long despised them. The population of Sanctuary is not very high, and the number of souls that can be obtained is naturally very limited. The Seven Demon Kings shouldn't be so concerned about Sanctuary.","In particular, Mephisto and the others had all participated in the original sin war. They had seen the powerful power that erupted from Uldyssian, and they were very clear about the power of Nephalem. Out of control, when the restriction of the World Stone on the Nephalems no longer exists, then the Nephalems are on the verge of losing control while their power is growing, and the Nephalems who will lose their humanity after losing control, will It will completely fall into the darkness, and it will become the best thug and tool used by the Demons!","In Roy's guess, this world should have given birth to a star-soul titan first, but this star-soul titan wanted to separate the two types of himself because of his death and ended up losing himself. Two purgatory spaces of High Heaven and flaming hell have been formed. Angels and demons just discovered this world and settled in. Then because the history of the eternal battle is too long, the angels and demons here are faintly independent. Therefore, they rarely mentioned the origins of the two parties themselves, and finally acquiesced to the myth of God Anu's creation.","In short, no matter what the Holy Light key is, this is one of Roy's chips now. For this key, he did not hold on to it like he did with Tyrael's soul, but promised to take it out. Give it to the Seven Demon Kings, but you have to exchange it accordingly.","In the early years, if the Seven Demons invaded Sanctuary only because of the World Stone, then after the World Stone was destroyed, the Seven Demons' coveted Sanctuary had also been transferred to Nephalem.","In the pervading dark fog, the strange bodies of the Seven Demon Kings are looming, and their shining eyes are the only light source in the darkness, making this picture so eerie.","In the world of Diablo, Sanctuary, High Heaven and Flame Hell are physically separated from each other. High Heaven and Flame Hell belong to different purgatory spaces, while Sanctuary is sandwiched between Hidden in the gap between the two.","Inside the Chaos Devil Palace, piles of skulls are hidden at the bottom of the walls, and countless skulls are scattered on the floor and piled up in the cracks of the walls, surrounded by hot magma, lava and huge torches standing on the ground, giving chaos The Devil's Temple brought a terrifying glimmer of light, illuminating the souls who were locked on the pillars and could not rest in peace.","It could be attributed to the prolonged conflict between the Seven Demon Kings and the High Heaven within this realm. Over time, both sides have become accustomed to their established ways of thinking and battle tactics, resulting in a stalemate. The victor seemed all but determined, until the unexpected arrival of Roy, an outsider. Caught off guard, the High Heaven lacked any understanding of his true power, rendering them vulnerable and easily overwhelmed in the face of Roy's presence. It was as if a simple touch of a button could cause their entire defense to crumble.","It's not uncommon for demons to turn allies into enemies, so Roy didn't participate in the dispute over the division of the cake between the Seven Demon Kings, but quietly watched their mutual filial piety.","Just like the Angiris Council organized by the angels, the Seven Demon Kings also formed a loose council called the Hellfire Council. This name is not as famous as the Angiris Council, even many demons in the Hell of Flame may not have heard of it. However, this council put it bluntly, that is, the Seven Demon Kings get together to discuss things, and there are no rules and regulations and programs of action.","Moreover, we need only consider the fate of Inarius, who fell into the clutches of Mephisto and his cohorts. His eyes were gouged out, and his wings and limbs tortured relentlessly. One can only imagine the unspeakable horrors that would befall Tyrael if he were to fall into their merciless grasp.","Not to mention the Seven Demons, even Roy wanted this world a little after he figured it out...","Of course he won't reveal his thoughts on Sanctuary here, but maybe his silence is a bit abnormal, so Mephisto noticed it, and Mephisto roared a few times, suppressing the rest of the demon kings After the sound of his voice, he turned to Roy and said, \"Osiris, don't you have any idea about Sanctuary? Don't worry, say your request, we will try our best to satisfy you!\"","Passing through the Plain of Despair and going deeper, it is the City of Punishment. The City of Punishment is almost close to the center of the Hell of Flames. It used to belong to the edge of the Lord of Destruction's territory. Baal likes to destroy, and it always builds a lot. Mighty buildings resembling mortal churches, and then destRoyg them all, is just the most trivial of the many destruction games of Lord of Destruction.","Roy felt that if his guess was correct, then this world might be the \"sowing ground\" of the Star Soul Titan. Otherwise, it would be impossible to explain that after God Anu, the Star Soul Titan, the Sanctuary actually gave birth to a tower. Trag'Oul, such a new star soul titan.","Roy glanced at Mephisto, then looked at Diablo, Baal, Andariel, Duriel, Azmodan and Belial who were sitting a little below, and sneered \"I don't want to. I speak because I don't think it makes any sense to discuss this now, Mephisto, don't forget, you saw Lilith's return in the future clip, as the mother of the Nephalem, you want to If the Sanctuary is included in the bag, you must pass the Lilith level. Before you defeat Lilith, what you discussed is all empty talk!\"","Several days have passed since the convening of the Hellfire Council. Right from the start, Andariel and the other four demon kings expressed their discontent with Roy's position. However, one by one, they were beaten by Roy's, eventually accepting his authority. As for the treatment of the High Heaven prisoners of war, the seven demon kings are well aware that Tyrael's soul now rests in Roy's hands. The Archangel Tyrael, known for his commitment to justice, is despised by the demon kings even more than Imperius.","Since heaven is at war with demons in thousands of worlds, various levels of heaven have also been derived. These heavens are the secondary military bases of angels, supporting the eternal war between angel legions and demons.","Since this key is potentially very risky, Roy does not intend to hold it, not to mention that this thing has to be used together with the cornerstone of the Flame Hell: the furnace of hell, so Roy did not ask too much. After exchanging a considerable number of souls from the Seven Demon Kings, he also gave away the keys.","So when he saw the extremely greedy expression on the faces of the Seven Demon Kings, Roy understood that it was impossible to convince the Seven Demon Kings to withdraw to the abyss world and keep the Sanctuary for himself.","So, after the end of the High Heaven war, Mephisto couldn't wait to invite Roy to the Hell of Flames as a guest.","The City of Punishment is a macabre sight, with bones strewn about in every direction, and the anguished souls of the damned writhing in eternal torment within their chains. The oppressive ground bears deep cracks, revealing glimpses of the fiery river that courses through the layers of the Hell of Flames. Undoubtedly, the River of Fire stands as the epitome of this infernal realm, its prominence unrivaled by any other.","The gate of hell opened by the efforts of the three demon gods is quite magnificent and huge. It was originally used to let the Hell Flame invade the Sanctuary, but the Demons were not very lucky, and this plan was eventually rejected. The high heavens discovered that the Nephalems, with the help of Tyrael, worked together to destroy the gate of hell.","The gate to Hell was a portal that opened when Mephisto, Diablo, and the Baal brothers were \"rebelled\" by the four demon lords, including Andariel. Subsequently, they were banished to Sanctuary but eventually found their way back to the Hellish realm known as the Hell of Flames. The three brothers were expelled.","The High Heaven has been destroyed and the problem immediately arises, because the Seven Demon Kings regard the Sanctuary as a forbidden place. After all, the Sanctuary has countless souls for them to seize, and there are powerful Nephalem powers that can be used by them. High Heaven Already down, Sanctuary is the most delicious fruit of victory they can get. They can't let Roy get involved, so they can't let Roy continue to stay in Sanctuary, cause they are afraid that Roy will sneak away first.","The place where the Hellfire Council was held was in Diablo's Chaos Demon Temple. In a room full of powerful dark forces in the deepest part of the Demon Temple, there were seven huge dark thrones. Arranged in order, the Seven Demon Kings each have a throne here.","The reason why there are so many descriptions is because there is a fact that the Hell of Flames is now full and each of the seven demon kings has an area under their control.","The Seven Demon Kings and Roy talked for a few days, even though they speak until their saliva was dry, Roy could not be shaken at all. In the end, they had to give up temporarily and turned to Roy to ask for another trophy.","The Seven Demon Kings have joined forces to fight against the High Heaven in this world for many years. Although they are a little bit naughty with each other, the overall friendship is still there, but when facing Roy, an outsider, the filth between them is all. let go.","The source of the River of Fire comes from the depths of the Chaos Demon Temple, the central area of ​​the Realm of Fear governed by Diablo, which is next to the Realm of Destruction.","This is a vast sea of ​​magma, which is mixed with winding rock paths. The river of flames seems to be the source of energy for the Flame Hell. This is also the core area of ​​the realm of destruction controlled by Baal. Demons have built many forgings here. Forge, use fire and lava to create demon weapons with dark powers to arm the demon army.","This is a very funny thing. Mephisto brought in Roy as a foreign aid from the abyss world, but he never seemed to think about how the site would be divided if Roy wanted to enter the Hell of Flames.","This is actually not to blame for Mephisto, even he did not expect that after Roy intervened in this world, the High Heaven would collapse so quickly.","This trophy, found in the ruins of the crystal arch, this is a key that condenses the power of the powerful Holy Light! After the Seven Demon Kings studied this thing, it turned out to be the real core of God Anu's Crest Crystal. After the original huge crystal of God Anu's Crest collapsed, it seemed that the remaining Holy Light power finally condensed into this key.","This was confirmed by interrogating Tyrael's soul. The higher-order heaven belongs to the next-level heaven below Eden and even the higher-order heaven is still related to Eden. Tyrael once projected from Eden. In the the projection book of truth, Tyrael found Roy's name, which is the proof.","Unlike the High Heaven that closed most of the portals, the Hell of Flames is actually open to the Sanctuary. The demons dream of invading the world of Sanctuary. Naturally, it will not restrict the exchanges between the Hell of Flames and the Sanctuary.","War is actually the most test of human nature. The world of Sanctuary has been repeatedly baptized by both High Heaven and flame hell.

In an attempt to harness the strength of her children, the Nephalems, she underestimated the resilience of humanity. Her offspring rebelled against their own mother, like a rebellious stage. For that, Lilith got banished to the void once again.\"","\"Mephisto, where are you taking us?\" Roy asked.","\"No, no, Osiris!\" Mephisto shook his finger at Roy and said, \"You may have made a mistake, it wasn't that we attacked Sanctuary to get Lilith revenge.

Limbs severed, the angel is trapped in a mortal form, while the chains siphon away their power relentlessly. A worn and ghastly visage hides beneath the hood, while the surrounding crystals reflect a pair of lidless eyes, fixed in a wild and desperate gaze. The angel is forced to confront their own visage, trapped within the reflective surfaces of these crystals.","After being reminded by Mephisto, Roy suddenly reacted, yes, Lilith's identity on the devil's side is still a traitor.","After hearing Mephisto's words, Roy was speechless for a while, and couldn't help but complain \"Mephisto, is your brain rotten? Since you have already seen the picture of the Seven Demon Kings being killed by Lilith, you still want to take action against Sanctuary? Have you ever thought that maybe it was because of your actions against Sanctuary that Lilith's revenge was provoked?\"","After that, Mephisto stood up from the dark throne. He waved his hand lightly and moved away the huge cornerstone of the throne, then Roy saw a faintly glowing fire on the cliff behind the cornerstone.","After thinking about it for a while, he frowned and asked Mephisto, \"Malthael?\"","After walking down the stairs, Roy eyes suddenly brightened. What appeared in front of Roy was a huge cave space, which was a huge sinkhole. The bottom of the sinkhole was constantly rolling high-temperature magma, and the scorching air was full of it. It is a poisonous gas with a stench and in the center of this lava lake, a stone pillar stands there.","Although he was still chatting and arguing with Mephisto and the others in Burning Hells, Roy was actually thinking about the possibility of jumping back...","Although this stone pillar is higher than the magma level, it is shorter than the position where Roy and the others are standing now.

The question remained: what would be her next move?","But Mephisto would not have thought that Roy and Lilith would have a natural possibility of joining forces...","Diablo and Baal knew what Mephisto was going to do, so they also stood up. They each shrank their bodies, and followed Mephisto into the hidden cave one after another.","Hearing Mephisto's words, the other six demon kings couldn't help but laugh awkwardly, especially when they saw the miserable appearance of Inarius, who could only wriggle, their hearts were filled with incomparable joy.","If you don't study, you won't understand. Mephisto is confident that after these words, Roy will definitely stand with them to deal with Lilith. There are eight demon kings in the Burning Hell and each one of their power is unprecedentedly powerful, even for Lilith to handle by herself. Mephisto couldn't make roy work together, so now he wanted to forcibly put Roy into their situation.","In addition, there is another kind of power in Inarius, Roy can see it after a little discrimination, that is... the power of death!","Inarius! Roy reacted at once.","Mephisto continued \"My brother and I both knew that Lilith would return one day, and we were prepared for her revenge. Before you came to this world Osiris, if we follow normal development, we may really fall into Lilith's hands, so in order to prevent this from happening, I finally thought of a way...\"","Mephisto nodded approvingly and said, \"That's right! It's Malthael, to be precise, his Mobius Mark! After the high heavens destroyed the angel of death, Malthael, they didn't find him. The soul returned to the crystal arch, so they thought he had completely died out, but they ignored a question, how could death itself still die? At that time, although Malthael body collapsed, his the Mobius Mark representing death still remained, and the remaining soul was also under the protection of this Mobius Mark. My clone took some time to find him in a ruined place outside the city of Westmarch. Malthael wanted resurrection, so I made a contract with him, I will help him find a body that suits him and he will become a member of our Burning Hell!\"","Mephisto then confirmed Roy's guess, saying \"Yes, the candidate I said is Inarius, once the advisor of the High Heaven Angiris Council and the deputy of the Archangel of Justice Tyrael, The creator of Sanctuary, and now a tragic outcast, I believe Lilith will be happy to see her husband in front of her when she returns?\"","Roy did not speak and observed Inarius' condition. He found that Inarius had actually fallen. It seemed that long-term imprisonment and torture had wiped out his mind. Roy saw fear and pain in him. , hatred and other negative emotions, but only without his own thoughts, the power emanating from this former archangel is completely dark now, which is already a manifestation of a fallen angel.","Roy didn't speak and followed the demon kings all the way down, and he didn't know how long he walked. Finally, he found that there was a dazzling fire in front of him and it was estimated that he had reached the place.","Roy had nothing to say when he heard this. Although he felt a bit pity about Lilith's circumstances at that time. After going through all these things, Lilith is nothing but a ghost. So Mephisto is right, no matter whether the Burning Hell will attack Sanctuary or not, after Lilith returns, she will definitely take revenge on Burning Hell. Of course, the original High Heaven is also within the scope of Lilith's revenge, but Because of Roy's intervention, Lilith now has one less target for revenge.","Roy inwardly sighed as he contemplated the situation. The denizens of Hell, those old timers, truly possessed an abundance of deceitful tactics up their sleeves. It appeared that the impending catastrophe loomed over the world of Sanctuary.","Roy naturally followed him in. As he walked, he observed the situation in the cave and found that a long staircase went straight down here, which seemed to lead to the depths of the ground.","Roy thought for a moment, then glanced at Mephisto with deep meaning, and said quietly \"Are you so sure that my appearance will change your future destiny, not cause the opposite effect?\"","Roy turned his head and looked at Diablo and Baal, and found that everyone nodded slightly in agreement with Mephisto's words.","Seeing that Roy was also nodding, Mephisto thought he agreed with what he said, so he continued with a bit of pride \"Of course, considering that Lilith may have hidden some power that we have not known, so in the in the next invasion of Sanctuary, there is no need for all of us to rush to show up for the time being, I have a better candidate here!\"","So Roy stopped talking, just nodded, but he had a mind buried in his heart","This is not to blame for Mephisto and the others. It is not because of their short-sightedness. In fact, with Mephisto's long lifespan, this old guy has seen too many things. Otherwise, he will not know that the void is eroding him. It's just that compared to Lilith, a demon who has been trying to find a solution to the erosion of the void, Mephisto's habitual thinking is that there is no solution to the erosion of the void."]}],[{"i":"540---gun-powder-smoke","l":"540 - Gun Powder Smoke","p":["\"Ah, another new world?\"","\"Don't talk nonsense!\" Roy snorted coldly \"Are Julia and Benia here?\"","\"Honey!\"","\"They right behind me!\" Rafaro responded, his body finally fully drilled out of the abyss gate, hovered in the sky.

When it existed, Inarius was the strongest in Sanctuary, and if it wasn't for that, he wouldn't have been able to exile Lilith. Although the Worldstone is destroyed, Inarius can no longer use the power of the Worldstone, but Mephisto brought him the Mobius Mark of Malthael...","Although the angels are not very friendly to the humans in the Sanctuary, Angles still the mortal enemies of the demon. In the past, when the High Heaven was still standing, heaven would definitely send an army to fight the demon in this situation. Now the High Heaven is gone and human beings can only rely on themselves. Up until this moment, those who partook in the expulsion of angels felt regretful. They have come to the realization that, unwittingly, they themselves buried the much-needed reinforcements that were rightfully theirs. Even if it is too late to regret, the people of Sanctuary can only fight.","Although the time flow rate of the world of Sanctuary is slightly different from the world of the abyss, it is not much different. Roy has been here for several years, and the world of the abyss has also passed a similar amount of time. Julia and Benia During this period of time, is going crazy thinking about Roy...","Although this is a very tragic country, due to its special geographical location, it was chosen by the Burning Hell as the outbreak site of this invasion. The Kingdom of Kehjistan is in the center of the Sanctuary world. When the army of demon emerge, it will soon spread to the whole world, forming an attack that blooms from the middle. The advantage of this is that the army of Hell can attack the surrounding kingdoms at the same time, forcing the human defense line to lengthen infinitely.","As the world of Sanctuary became shrouded in smoke, Roy's gate to the abyss was nearing completion. Given that Sanctuary resides within the space of purgatory, establishing a direct connection to the abyss world would cause a tremendous disturbance. Roy, being aware of this, strategically chose a location on the frozen sea for his gate. This ensured that even with significant activity, mortal beings would remain silent to it. The sole entity who could potentially sense and comprehend such a phenomenon, the star-soul titan Trag'Oul, would surely think twice before intervening to halt Roy's plans.","At borders of various kingdoms have ignited beacon fires representing the invasion of demons. They opened the door of the treasury and distribute a large number of armors and weapons, hurriedly sending their soldiers to the frontier.","Desperation spreads quietly among ordinary humans, especially after news from the front line informing humans that the one who brought the army of Hell to attack Sanctuary this time turned out to be their former creator Inarius, this kind of bad news frustrated them even more.","During this period, Roy, Mephisto, and the Seven Demon Kings, didn't showed up. They hid behind the scenes to observe, cause they knew that Lilith would definitely show up.","Even in this circumstances, the Nephalems still have a strong spirit of resistance in their bones. They have resisted angels, demons, and even their own mothers, so it seems that it is not difficult to resist their father now. Ordinary nephalems may feel pessimistic, but those elite nephalem warriors who have awakened the power of nephalem and continue to grow stronger in battle will not go down easily. A counter-attack was launched towards the army of hell, and many soldiers even reached the depths of the enemy camp at one point, trying to execute the decapitation tactics on Inarius.","Humans in the Sanctuary all have Nephalem blood, the difference is only thin or not. Most of the soldiers actually still have a certain combat ability, they can use swords and weapons proficiently, and also have certain magical ability. After passing through training, the battle formation and defense line they formed can deal with ordinary demons, but the middle, upper, lord, and king in the army of Hell need more powerful Nephalems to deal with.","In just over two months, the army of Hell led by Inarius, spread like cancer cells. Spreading throughout the entire Sanctuary and make everything into ruin.","In the land Inarius once created, Inarius wreaked havoc of immense proportions. In a mere day, the kingdom of Kehjistan was left in ruins. The ground, trodden upon by Inarius and his hellish army, was scorched and blackened by relentless flames. Rivers that once flowed now ran dry, their beds cracked. The once-vibrant foliage withered away, and the once-teeming wildlife perished. In the wake of their destruction, an army of maggots and flies descended upon the decaying remains, feasting upon the spoils of decay. Forests became engulfed in flames, while poisonous mists wafted through the marshlands.","In the wilderness, human skeletons can be seen everywhere. They may have been adventurers, thieves, or soldiers of the human kingdom in their lifetimes, but now they are lying on the ground. Their swords are broken, their armor is tattered, and their flesh and blood have long been torn by demons. The bones are full of gnawing marks, all kinds of poisonous insects get in and out of the skeleton's eye sockets, and the earth is dead silent. The carrion-eating crows and vultures in the sky emit cheerful and strange chirping, like countless souls howling, constantly cursing the purgatory-like world.","It has to be said that the humans in Sanctuary still have their own inferiority. Before the demons of Hell really came, the kingdoms were still fighting each other, kings and nobles, nobles and nobles, and religions and religions. Bullshit, they were not able to form a real unified resistance front and alliance, even when the kingdom of Kehjistan asked for help from the neighboring kingdoms, the neighboring kingdoms were still reluctant to believe it because of their own financial and interest issues.","It was not until the news of the destruction of the kingdom of Kehjistan came that the kingdoms in Sanctuary woke up like a dream. The sense of crisis of genocide really came to them at this time. Humans hurriedly recruited soldiers, formed a defense line, and resisted the demons invasion.","It's just that the angel Inarius is power can't be compere to, even for the elite nephalem. He used to be Tyrael's deputy and was second only to the five archangels. Compared with the demons, he is above the lord, the quasi demon king.","Julia and Benia rushed into Roy's arms excitedly and desperately sniffed the breath on Roy's body.","Now, Inarius possesses a formidable combat prowess comparable to that of an archangel or a Demon King. He proves to be a challenging adversary for the forces of Hell. Among the group of Nephalem warriors who joined forces to defeat Diablo, it proves exceptionally challenging for the remaining Nephalem to defeat him. Despite multiple attempts to overpower him through various strategies, Inarius take the lives of numerous Nephalem in return.","On the seventh day after the Hellfire Council was held, a huge gate of Hell opened in the kingdom of Kehjistan in Sanctuary, and the army of Hell poured out from the gate like a tide.","Roy did not continue to stay in the Burning Hell. He had no intention to go to Burning Hell to compete with the Seven Devils for the limited territory of Hell and he didn't like it either.

It make other Demon Kings never thought Roy do harm to them.

The long torment of the Seven Demon Kings for thousands of years has completely defeated his mind, and the dark power of the flaming hell has completely corrupted him into He was a fallen angel. After being released, although he recovered his body and limbs, the light wings behind him had turned gray and black. What filled his brain was only endless hatred and fear. I just want to vent my crazy thoughts that want to destroy everything.","The defense line is stretched and human resistance becomes very tight. The number of Nephalem elite warriors with strong power is relatively small. After investing in the defense lines of various places, it is only a drop in the bucket, even if humans have tried their best to resist. From time to time, kingdoms fell, cities turned into ruins, and fertile fields turned into scorched earth.","The Kingdom of Kehjistan, once a mighty realm within the world of Sanctuary, served as the birthplace of the mage tribe. However, owing to the inquisitive nature of mages, seekers of truth, they ventured to test the limits even on the original demons inhabiting Sanctuary. It was through magical experimentation that the existence of the Burning Hells was revealed. Subsequently, due to conflicts within the mage tribe, the kingdom's decline was swift. Not too long ago, Kehjistan faced further turmoil when it fell under the rule of Belial, the Lord of Lies, who seized control even at the cost of their king's life.","The Seven Demon Kings didn't know what Roy had done. Given that Roy hid after his arrival and then suddenly broke out to tie the High Heaven, the Seven Demon Kings did not feel too strange about Roy's disappearance. They just thought that Roy planned something again.","The tragedy of the kingdom of Kehjistan soon spread throughout the Sanctuary. Although after the destruction of the High Heaven, the kingdoms of the Sanctuary had already anticipated the invasion of the Hell Army and made some defenses against it, but They didn't expect the demons to come so quickly, so they were caught off guard.","These powerful elite Nephalem warriors are generally trained in various religious organizations. Fortunately, at the time of human survival, these religious organizations also knew the benefits and sent their most powerful warriors to the front line.","This kind of strategy was proposed by Azmodan, a Hell warrior. He is one of the few strategic talents who can command large-scale wars among the Seven Demon Kings. Of course, this time he did not show up in person, but let Inarius stand in the front. The fallen Inarius is now the best tool in Burning Hell.","With the high-pitched dragon roar, his huge body continuously extended from the fault space of the Abyss Gate. Rafaro's telepathy voice reach Roy's mind and said to Roy \"My master, after so long, have you finally remembered to summon me?\"","With the power of Demon King Roy, the gate of the abyss that has been opened is very huge.

They have a huge army, but the demons here will only obey them, so you asked us to bring your army here?\"","Contrary to the perplexity of others, only Roy comprehended the full picture. As Roy, aided by his Imps' reconnaissance, pondered the matter, he surmised that Lilith's delay in taking action likely stemmed from her anticipation of an opportune moment, which might just be unfolding at present. Roy himself was engaged in a similar endeavor—amassing his own army.","Despite Mendeln's willingness to welcome Lilith back once more, hoping for her assistance in future disaster, Lilith would not immediately oblige. She would only take action once a Nephalem confessed their transgressions to her and beg her forgiveness.","During the period of Roy's departure, Julia and Benia were not idle, and they have been expanding Roy's demon army. They constantly recruited a large number of demons from the upper and middle layers of the abyss world. With the recruitment of a large number of high-ranking demons, coupled with the demon lords like Belial, the Overlord of the Hell Prison, and Lady Styx, Roy's Demon King's army has grown quite large.","For once, the Seven Demon Kings, even Roy were wrong in their estimation. Lilith may have returned, but when the humans in Sanctuary were attacked by the army of demons, Lilith did not immediately stand up to protect her children. Although Lilith is indeed the mother of the Nephalems and she also has motherhood, but she is still and always be a demon. At first, because of Uldyssian's rebellion against her, she was banished to the Void. It can't be forgiven so easily!","For that, even if Mendeln welcomed her back again, in hope to get Lilith's help in the next disaster, Lilith will not full fill it immediately. She will take action, as soon as Nephalem confessed to her and got her forgiveness.","Hearing this, Roy's eyes widened. Although Roy knew that Cerberus had been chasing after the fat tiger, he never thought that Cerberus would actually treat the fat tiger as a fool. The naive and straight male dog was won. During the period when he was not in Frostfire City, Fat Tiger became a father!?","However, out of the worship of Roy's powerful power, all the demon lords did not have much doubts. They would do whatever Roy told them to do, even if it was to fight the Demon King.","However, what makes people feel strange is that these necromancers, who have long upheld the principle of balance, seemed to deviate from their own name. Rather than advocating for the concept of balance as they had done before, they shifted their focus to emphasizing that the Nephalem themselves were burdened with the sins of their mother.","In addition, this world also has a star soul Titan Trag'Oul, and a Red Sea Queen Lilith.

During this period of time, the war situation in Sanctuary has also undergone tremendous changes.","On the contrary, Julia asked worriedly \"What's the matter? Darling, have you and Mephisto turned against each other?\"","Prior to launching an assault on the High Heavens, Roy relied on the aid of the Seven Demon Kings' demon army to distract and engage the four archangels, including Imperius. The situation remains the same now. To confront them in the realm of the Seven Demon Kings, Roy must gather his own forces. Having an army to contend with the enemy's cannon fodder is essential, which is why he seeks to summon Julia and the others to bolster his ranks.","Roy is really a question mark in his head. In other words, when he created Fat Tiger, did he add fertility to him? Or did the system complete it for him?","Roy looked up and saw Fat Tiger's huge titan body, which had also emerged from the gate of the abyss. Sareth, was riding on the back of the fat tiger.

Roy looked at the fat tiger lying like a hill in front of him and asked Julia, \"What's wrong with this guy? Why did he suddenly become calm?\"","That's the army that Julia and Benia brought from Frostfire City...","The necromancers, who have long secluded themselves from society and immersed in dealings with the dead, were caught off guard by this turn of events. Their devotion to Trag'Oul's doctrine of balance led them astray, causing a significant lack of understanding of human society. Paradoxically, their unintended influence inadvertently provided a respite for the human defense line. The kingdoms, bolstered by this newfound confidence, started to believe in their own abilities once more. They no longer felt reliant on a Nephalem Mother to rescue them, but rather believed in the capability of humanity to vanquish the demons on their own.","The Overlord of the Flame Prison, Belial, this big flaming cow came over with his sword of flame. It could be seen that the frozen environment around him made him very uncomfortable. He came to Roy and lowered his head. Salute to Roy, and then sprayed with sparks and asked, \"Your Majesty, are you calling us this time to destroy the world?\"","The situation remained consistent. Just as the Nephalem heroes who had triumphed over Diablo in the High Heavens were sought out by the ruling class, urging them to return to the battlefield and confront the forces of Hell once more in an attempt to defeat Inarius, confusion reigned among the necromancers and the Seven Deadly Sins. Inarius had not yet brought forth Lilith?","Then both Fat Tiger and Sareth saw Roy, Sareth waved at Roy excitedly, urging Fat Tiger to run quickly. But it was different from the past. This time, the fat tiger didn't rush over to lick Roy like a tank. Instead, he calmly carried Sareth over slowly, and got him down in front of Roy.","These words suddenly made Belial almost stumble to the ground. He looked at Roy in disbelief and said, \"Seven... seven demon kings?\"","This is why the necromancers of the Rathma sect have suddenly emerged, advocating the concept of the original sin. With Mendeln present, they are among the first to comprehend the gravity of the original sin war. Now, they aim to spread the message of this historical conflict, urging people to repent and seek redemption from Lilith.","Unfortunately, this endeavor proved futile rather swiftly. For many Nephalem, whose lifespans are relatively short, events that occurred thousands of years ago are distant memories. They display a profound indifference towards such matters. Moreover, since they have never personally witnessed the existence of the \"Mother of Nephalem,\" the concept holds little weight in their minds. Additionally, the somber demeanor and appearance of the Necromancers contribute to an inherent distrust among ordinary Nephalem. In fact, many individuals have subconsciously developed conspiracy theories, questioning whether the necromancers harbor ulterior motives aimed at seizing their souls.","When the territory of human beings was constantly falling under the offensive of the army of hell, when the resistance of human beings became more and more difficult, the necromancers of the Rathma sect appeared. These necromancers who hadn't been accepted by the world were brought with the undead army and joined the front line against the demons. With the help of the immortal undead army, mankind finally stand their ground under the attack of the demons."]}]]
