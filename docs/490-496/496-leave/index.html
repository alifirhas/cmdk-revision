<p>After showing his current strength a little bit, Roy felt very satisfied, so he refocused his attention on separating the two purgatory spaces.</p>
<p>The void power that emerged from the void rift was neutralized by Roy’s chaotic body. This caused the void rift to be powerless after the evolution of Roy’s bloodline and was closed again, so Roy&#x27;s next operation no longer has to worry about opening the void rift.</p>
<p>The two fusion purgatory spaces are torn apart along the boundary, and given a little inertial force. The two purgatory spaces begin to separate slowly. After this step, Roy has basically succeeded. It only takes a while and the two purgatory spaces will return to their original positions. It will re-wrap the human world of the two worlds and restore to the complete world as before.</p>
<p>While Roy separated the two purgatory spaces, the various weird phenomena that appeared in the human world on both sides have completely disappeared. People can no longer see the projection of angels and demons, nor can they see the scene of the two fighting each other. Don&#x27;t worry about falling into the space cracks and entering the dangerous purgatory space anymore.</p>
<p>Of course, the aftermath of this event is indelible in the human world in a short period of time, subverting ordinary human cognition and the phenomenon of the Three Views. This time it can be said to be witnessed by the whole people, and it is impossible to even explain it with hallucinations. It may not be long before all kinds of weird religions in the human world will rise, using their own imagination and understanding to try to explain what happened this time, and the rise of these religions is bound to affect the scientific development of the human world will caused a huge impact...</p>
<p>But these have nothing to do with Roy, he is ready to return to the abyssal world.</p>
<p>In fact, after separating the two purgatory spaces, Roy originally wanted to give it a try. He went to see the human world where Bayonetta was, but unfortunately, when he tried to enter the human world, he was met with an unprecedented huge rebound in the human world!</p>
<p>It’s okay when I was in the purgatory space, and it didn’t feel obvious, but the rejection of Roy, the demon king, in the main world of Bayonetta and the others was unprecedentedly fierce. The moment Roy tried to enter, it seemed like the whole world. All the power was concentrated, and Roy flew out fiercely.</p>
<p>The strength of this blow, if I had to describe it, would not be less than millions of tons of strength...</p>
<p>In the face of the world’s repulsive effect, even if Roy used the power of the gods and authority, he was also rejected. The main world held incomparably deep malice against a powerful demon like Roy and would never allow him to enter. restricted area.</p>
<p>To be honest, Roy was also a little confused about this situation. Of course, he also knew how difficult it is for a Demon King Demon to enter a main world, but he did not expect it to be so difficult.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut...&quot; Roy sipped unwillingly, and secretly said &quot;If you don&#x27;t go, don&#x27;t go, do you think I really want to go?&quot;</p>
<p>With that said, Roy couldn&#x27;t help but think of Rodin. That guy is Mephisto&#x27;s clone, but he can stay in the human world. From this point of view, there is actually a way for Roy to go to the main world. You only need to create a clone with a lower power level to represent him in the past.</p>
<p>But Roy would not do this. He is now cautious about creating clones, and will never create clones at will. Even if they are to be created, they must ensure that the clones can be completely under his control.</p>
<p>So after thinking about it, Roy stopped struggling, and greeted Julia, Sparda and the others &quot;Go, go back to the Demon World!&quot;</p>
<p>After Roy and Sparda disappeared in the space channel, Jeanne and Bayonetta, who were still in the heaven, breathed a sigh of relief. Roy tried to enter the human world before. It really shocked the two of them. Fortunately, the rules of the world they were in were still very complete, which prevented Roy&#x27;s actions. Otherwise, the two really didn&#x27;t know what to do.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, speaking of it, you made it!&quot; Jeanne elbows Bayonetta&#x27;s waist, and said &quot;When you signed the power contract with Osiris, I was afraid that he did not think of him. Will it become stronger afterwards?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot; Bayonetta stretched out her hand to hold the black-framed glasses, and said &quot;This is equivalent to keeping a stronger hole card at a lower price!&quot;</p>
<p>[1] Jeanne raised her head and looked into the distance. There were some ancient angels appearing in and they were approaching them. Seeing this scene, Jeanne jokingly said &quot;At this point, the angels and The demon are no different!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn&#x27;t it?&quot; Bayonetta turned the two red guns with both hands, and said &quot;As soon as the Great demon left, they came over. It seems that the lesson is still not enough...&quot;</p>
<p>The two beautiful young ladies look at each other. With a charming smile, the next second, the sound of endless gunfire sounded again, allowing golden blood and feathers to float in the heavenly sky again...</p>
<hr />
<p>On the other side, Roy, who returned to the Demon World, took a deep breath and said to Sparda, &quot;The air here is much more refreshing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The holy light of heaven is really unfriendly to the demon...&quot; Sparda agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is still a difference between the Demon World and the Abyss!&quot; Roy said, &quot;Sparda, are you sure you want to stay here, don&#x27;t you go back to the Abyss World with me?&quot;</p>
<p>Sparda shook his head and said, &quot;This is my second hometown. All my descendants are here. They are all children of taboo. If I go back to the Abyss World, I will definitely be targeted!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With me protecting you, what are you afraid of?&quot; Roy sniffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for your solicitation, Your Majesty!&quot; Sparda bowed to Roy and said &quot;I can guard the Demon World for you, but it really won&#x27;t work to return to the abyss...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Demon World here doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me!&quot; Roy shook his head and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t intend to be king here. This Demon World has been isolated from the abyss for too long and has become a system of its own.&quot;</p>
<p>Sparda&#x27;s words to Roy were understood as a pure abyssal demon&#x27;s reserve and pride in the bloodline, so he did not dare to speak. As everyone knows, Roy really has no interest in this world, no matter how vast the demon world is, Can there be an abyss and the world is vast? Can the Demon World have a spatial channel connected to the Ten Thousand Realms like the Abyss World?</p>
<p>Nothing! So for Roy, the Demon World here can only be regarded as a third- and fourth-tier city. Where can there be a first-tier big city like Abyss?</p>
<p>After gaining a godhead and being promoted to the rank of Demon King, and successfully evolving into Chaos Demon, Roy’s past insecurity has been eliminated a lot. He knows that from now on, there are not many things that can threaten his life. After the insecurity is eliminated, it is replaced by the desire to explore the unknown.</p>
<p>Does the abyss world have an end? How many realms does it connect? Where are the other archangels and demon kings? What is High Heaven like? Does the creator of the angel and demon Titan really exist? What&#x27;s the matter with the void?</p>
<p>After becoming a demon, Roy also accepted his identity. As a human being, his life was short, but as an immortal species like a demon, he has endless time. If he doesn’t do anything, how can he pass this long time?</p>
<p>So many unknowns aroused Roy&#x27;s curiosity, and he can&#x27;t wait to explore now.</p>
<p>It’s fine if Sparda doesn’t accept his solicitation. Anyway, Madame Styx and the others, the demon lord, have been recruited by Roy. It doesn’t make any difference whether one more Sparda or one less Sparda, so he waved his hand and Roy stopped talking. What, led everyone into the entrance of the abyss gate.</p>
<p>Seeing the demons follow Roy one by one, the four Sparda grandparents didn&#x27;t know what they were thinking.</p>
<p>Sareth seemed to have thought about it, so he deliberately fell behind and said to Dante at the end &quot;Dante, Nero, are you going to re-seal this abyss entrance?&quot;</p>
<p>Dante glanced at Sparda, nodded and whispered &quot;Yes, as long as this entrance still exists, there will always be demons from the abyss world entering the demon world again. We cannot guarantee that every demon that comes in will be righteous like your Foster Father and can communicate friendly...&quot;</p>
<p>Nero also said &quot;Although I don&#x27;t want to admit it, Sparda... Grandpa did lie to your foster father...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heh, foster father won&#x27;t care!&quot; Sareth waved his hand and said, &quot;Otherwise, he would have taken you away forcibly. I just think that maybe you can keep a little back door when you seal the entrance, at least, Let me come and play with you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look for us to play?&quot; Dante and Nero looked at each other in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Sareth nodded and pointed to Dante. &quot;Although you always rubs my hair, but in general, it&#x27;s fun to be with you, I think we are friends?&quot;</p>
<p>Dante laughed, squatting down and looking at Sareth and then stretched out his hand to signal Sareth. Sareth also understood in seconds, so a big hand and a small hand were squeezed together.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, we are friends!&quot; Dante said &quot;We will leave a way for you. As you child of taboo, you should be able to easily travel between the abyss and the demon world. Next time, I will treat you to food. Strawberry milkshake!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a deal!&quot; Sareth smiled, turned and ran directly into the gate of the abyss.</p>
<p>Seeing Sareth leaving, Vergil stepped forward and said to the people with some doubts &quot;In fact, I have always had a question, is Osiris we encountered this time really a demon? I have never heard of it. Which demon will help us stabilize the world and his righteous son is such a child of taboo son with a good personality... I feel surprised no matter how you think about it...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know, I can&#x27;t say it!&quot; Sparda sighed &quot;But maybe he just feels good because of his smooth promotion? Don&#x27;t use our minds to guess the moody behavior of the demon king... This Demon King looks the same no matter how different...&quot;</p>
<p>After the grandfather and grandson stayed silent for a while, they took out their magic swords together and began to seal the channel of the abyss and the demon world...</p>
<p>This also means that Roy&#x27;s journey in these two twin worlds has come to an end...</p>
