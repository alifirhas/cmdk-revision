<p>Eyes are the only way most creatures use to observe the world. However, in the eyes of different creatures, perhaps they observe the world differently.</p>
<p>Frogs are highly sensitive to moving objects in nature, but their vision is less clear when they are stationary. Most insects possess compound eyes, making it difficult to comprehend their visual perception. Snakes have limited vision but rely on thermal detection to locate prey. Human eyes can perceive a visual image of 576 million pixels and discern approximately 1 million colors, even though color blindness and color weakness are common. The mantis shrimp, on the other hand, exhibits exceptional color discrimination ability, being capable of distinguishing up to 16 colors, including ultraviolet and infrared rays invisible to humans. Additionally, they can detect linearly and circularly polarized light. However, as the mantis shrimp lacks intelligence, it remains elusive to describe the world they perceive through their eyes...</p>
<p>All of this stems from the different eye structures between creatures.</p>
<p>Roy noticed a different structure of his eyes from the moment he became a demon. At least when he was born as a human, he couldn&#x27;t see the soul at all, but as a demon, he could. In addition, there is a dark vision, the ability to see clearly in darker places is completely different from humans.</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s eyes have undergone a lot of evolution afterward. Compared with other demons, he has radiation vision. Therefore, the world scene that Roy sees in his eyes is naturally indescribable. But even so... the world he saw before and the world he saw after the integration of the Divine Spark was completely incomparable!</p>
<p>As Julia and Benia stared in surprise, a gap opened in the center of Roy&#x27;s forehead as he squinted his eyebrows. His tough demon skin seemed to have been cut with a knife and it slowly spread to both sides, revealing a newly emerged demon&#x27;s eye inside.</p>
<p>The white part of the eye of this demon&#x27;s eye is entirely red, with a dazzling feeling. Only the narrow and long pupil in the middle is covered with a touch of gold. The whole eye looks very strange, which makes people feel chilly and unsettled. A strange sense of holiness...</p>
<p>Yes, a sense of holiness! This word appears to be the most inappropriate adjective for creatures like demons, but it just appeared...</p>
<p>The emergence of this new vertical pupil signifies the fusion of Mobius Mark from Divine Spark and Roy. Through this extraordinary eye, Roy&#x27;s perception undergoes an immense transformation.</p>
<p>Attempting to explain these changes becomes a challenging task. These visions manifest on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. In the microscopic realm, Roy witnesses a multitude of particles permeating the atmosphere, radiating a distinctly unfamiliar light. It becomes clear to Roy that what he observes are elements—countless elements inundating the world, engaging in a ceaseless dance akin to Brownian motion. They collide, merge, and separate in irregular patterns, creating a mesmerizing spectacle.</p>
<p>Roy raised his hand, intending to utilize his magical powers to condense a piece of ice within his palm. To his astonishment, he observed an extraordinary force field emanating from his palm. Upon making contact with this force field, an array of elemental particles, potentially including water, swiftly converged and gathered within his grasp. Through a process of relentless compression, fusion, and meticulous alignment, the once-invisible microscopic particles underwent a remarkable metamorphosis, transitioning into tangible matter. As a result, a diamond-shaped piece of ice materialized in the palm of Roy&#x27;s hand.</p>
<p>It was amazing. This kind of vision, seeing the whole process of magic forming with his own eyes was simply too mesmerizing for Roy. He never thought that the magic he had released in the past was made in this way.</p>
<p>In the past, Roy was unable to perceive the invisible force field generated by his magical power. However, he now possesses a profound understanding of how magic power serves as a conduit for elemental communication. This realization occurred within the realm of microscopic observation. Roy tilted his head slightly, gazing into the distance. The vertical pupil at the center of his brow contracted, mimicking a camera lens, and changing his visions to a microscopic perspective. Roy beheld the macroscopic scene unfolding before him.</p>
<p>In addition to the world and colors observed, there are many more things Roy can&#x27;t describe in the macro scene. It may be a special ray that was difficult to perceive in the past. Roy can&#x27;t tell for a while. Something, but the most special thing is that Roy saw... strings!</p>
<p>String, let&#x27;s call it that way because it is composed of somewhat translucent, void, and ethereal threads. These countless threads are intertwined vertically and horizontally to form a sheet that covers the entire sky, even covers the sky like a big net of the whole world!</p>
<p>This big net floods the world and makes all people and things shrouded in it, including Julia and Benia, who are close at hand, and many similar lines seem to extend from their bodies. Coming out, it is the same as the countless threads intertwined in this world.</p>
<p>The reason why the word &quot;string&quot; suddenly comes to mind is that when Roy saw these misty threads, the first thing that came to his mind was puppets! Because the two of them looked like they were being caught in his eyes at the moment. Like puppets connected by countless wires...</p>
<p>&quot;What are these lines?&quot; Roy thought strangely, &quot;Could it be that these are the so-called lines of fate?&quot;</p>
<p>In some literary works, there are often such sentences and adjectives &quot;The goddess of fate has plucked the strings of fate&quot;. Roy didn&#x27;t think there was anything in this sentence before, but now he saw these illusory threads with his own eyes. Roy suddenly discovered that perhaps this sentence may be true.</p>
<p>There is the so-called &quot;string of fate&quot;!</p>
<p>Raising his hand, Roy saw that countless such strings were extending from his body. These strings that swayed slightly like green smoke were intertwined with the strings that originally existed in this world, completely indifferent to each other.</p>
<p>To verify whether his guess was correct, Roy looked around and found that there was a broken floating island on the far horizon. It was a small piece of debris from the floating island of Heaven that was crushed in the previous war. There are still countless wires connected, so Roy raised his hand to release a huge group of destruction flames, destroying it.</p>
<p>However, after destroying the wreckage, Roy frowned, and thought &quot;It&#x27;s not right, it shouldn&#x27;t be like this&quot;. He saw that the floating island wreckage itself spread after being destroyed. The string that came out has not disappeared but changed to another form and continues to blend into the strings of this world.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Julia and Benia didn&#x27;t know what was going on. They just watched Roy inexplicably raise his hand to destroy the wreckage of the floating island, but now they frowned and asked curiously.</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t answer them but thought carefully for a moment and suddenly looked at the wreckage of another floating island in the distance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this time, Roy refrained from using magic. Instead, he cautiously extended his hand, with the five sharp fingers poised towards the wreckage, making a gentle, almost graceful dance.</p>
<p>Julia and Benia dared disturb Roy and watched Roy&#x27;s movements silently. As Sareth, Dante, Nero, and the others returned, Julia and Benia brought their fingers to their lips, gesturing with a hiss, giving a hint to the group &quot;Don&#x27;t disturb Roy.&quot;</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, Roy seemed to have caught something, and the dancing fingers suddenly squeezed together. In the next moment, Roy saw the remains of the floating island with an area of ​​thousands of square meters in the distance suddenly cracked and turned into countless dust.</p>
<p>Amidst the gaze of everyone present, Roy detected no magical fluctuations or signs of elemental intervention, yet the wreckage succumbed to destruction. Witnessing this perplexing scene, Julia and the others exchanged bewildered glances, unsure of what was unfolding before them.</p>
<p>&quot;Foster father, what did you just do?&quot; Sareth asked curiously.</p>
<p>Roy did not answer him, but looked at his demon&#x27;s claws with some fascination, and muttered to himself &quot;So that&#x27;s the case, the power of disturbance? Or is this the so-called authority!?&quot;</p>
<p>No one knows what he did just now, only Roy himself knows. He has been trying to figure out a way to move the &quot;strings&quot; spreading out on the floating island. After trying for a long time, he finally found out. The root can let him &quot;pick&quot; the &quot;string&quot;, and when he grabs and directly breaks the &quot;string&quot;, the floating island is immediately destroyed!</p>
<p>In this feeling, it is great! Roy can feel that it is a supreme power!</p>
<p>After hearing Roy&#x27;s murmurs, Julia and Benia&#x27;s eyes filled with astonishment. While they were aware of Roy&#x27;s fusion with the Divine Spark, they had not anticipated him mastering it with such swiftness. He had grasped the power of authority.</p>
<p>In the sky, four vigorous steeds came in the air, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse came slowly towards Roy on their respective mounts. Farther away, Bayonetta and Jeanne also stepped on their feet. The magical aperture is constantly jumping, rushing towards this side.</p>
<p>The tremendous force unleashed by Jubileus&#x27;s fall resulted in a powerful explosion that sent nearly everyone flying a considerable distance. Fortunately, being in heaven provided ample space, mitigating the impact of self-detonation on those affected. Although injuries were substantial, Roy fortuitously found himself blown into the exact location where he could seize Jubileus&#x27;s Divine Spark directly. This turn of events significantly worsened the complexion of the ongoing war.</p>
<p>Divine Spark is a good thing, but this kind of good thing falls into the hands of a demon, that’s another matter. Even if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were summoned by Roy, this doesn’t mean they would like to see Roy. A new Demon King is born.</p>
<p>So when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse came to Roy, the first person who spoke is War, with a stinky face he said: &quot;Demon, this is the only time and the last time we help you, don&#x27;t think about using us to deal with your enemy ever again!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy looked at War, grinned, and said &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I also know that you will not do anything for me again. My promise is still valid. Next time you meet, you will face the ‘void’!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so!&quot; War snorted, the four knights didn&#x27;t say a word, their bodies turned into four rays of light, and they disappeared into the sky in an instant. It looks like they can’t wait to return...</p>
<p>After seeing the departure of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, Roy shifted his gaze towards Sparda, Dante, Virgil, and Nero. In the present moment, all four of them remained in their demonic forms, maintaining a watchful and vigilant eye on Roy.</p>
<p>They certainly knew that Roy had merged with Mobius Mark and become the new demon king, but the demon was the most difficult creature to trust. They didn’t know whether they were doing it right or not, but if Roy became the demon king, he wanted to treat these two The world is unfavorable, so their grandfather and grandson are fighting for their lives to stop Roy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Roy didn&#x27;t have anything to do with these twin worlds...</p>
