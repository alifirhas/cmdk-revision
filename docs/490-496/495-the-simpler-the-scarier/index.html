<p>Don&#x27;t talk about nails, even the demon horns on Roy&#x27;s head turn into a fog.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s like a middle-aged man suddenly starts to lose his hair, even if he says something he doesn&#x27;t care about it, he still tries all the hair growth products secretly... It&#x27;s a pain that was completely incomprehensible when it happen if you are young...</p>
<p>The same is true for demons. Demon’s horns are a symbol of male demons. When the demon’s horns were still there, Roy could not help but rub them. The sense of comfort and security that comes is unparalleled.</p>
<p>But after suddenly discovering that his horns were gone and there was only a misty fog on his head, Roy&#x27;s mood was undoubtedly very anxious.</p>
<p>As Roy&#x27;s mood shifted, the mist enveloping his body grew increasingly agitated and restless. The swirling mist caused the air surrounding him to assume an aura of solemnity, heightening the atmosphere around him.</p>
<p>A sudden wave of suffocation engulfed Sparda and the others, accompanied by a profound sense of constriction. They felt an abrupt obstruction within their bodies, rendering their magic power nearly inert and severing their ability to communicate with the surrounding elements.</p>
<p>This is even more true for Bayonetta and Jeanne. Amidst all the exclaims, the magic pattern under their feet used to float in the air suddenly disappeared, and the two of them suddenly fell from mid-air. if not for Dante&#x27;s quick reaction to immediately transformed into sin demon form and flew over, both of them may fall directly from the heavens back to the world...</p>
<p>&quot;This... is the forbidden domain?&quot; Surprise surged within Sparda&#x27;s heart, nearly boiling over. While he understood that Roy&#x27;s actions were unintentional, it was precisely this lack of control that made it all the more terrifying. The power unleashed by individuals when their emotions fluctuate can pose great challenges. What if they were to do it intentionally?</p>
<p>The fall of Bayonetta and Jeanne made Roy come back to his senses, realizing that their present situation is related to him, so he can only calm down and restrain his emotions.</p>
<p>Everyone felt a little better...</p>
<p>Roy found that after turning into this misty state, it seemed that he had acquired some special abilities, but it was not the time to explore these abilities at the moment, so he could only wait to return to the abyss world.</p>
<p>Julia and Benia were overcome with excitement. Despite Roy&#x27;s current transformation, he had managed to endure the erosion of the void. Moreover, they observed that the progression of the void had slowed down significantly. The void rifts were sealed shut, and there was no trace of void power remaining on Roy&#x27;s body. This indicated that Roy not only triumphed over the void&#x27;s erosion but also reversed the process, expelling the void power from within himself.</p>
<p>This is an incredible thing...</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, have you truly become the Chaos Demon?&quot; Julia wanted to hug Roy, but looking at his ethereal and illusory appearance, she didn&#x27;t know how to hug him, so she could only ask curiously.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not sure... it&#x27;s...&quot; Roy replied. He has no mouth now, but the demon&#x27;s words can still be &quot;spoken&quot; and that kind of puzzled tone echoes in the sea of ​​souls of everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;Not sure?&quot; Benia was also very curious. She flapped her wings and flew around Roy, observing the condition of his body. Gradually, Benia saw something and said in surprise <a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a> &quot;My dear, you... how can these mists on your body be...&quot;</p>
<p>Benia couldn&#x27;t continue, because the changes in Roy&#x27;s body truly exceeded her cognition.</p>
<p>In truth, Roy also discovered that, combined with the changes in his pedigree in the system panel, the fog on him is composed entirely of many elements.</p>
<p>But this element is not an element in the conventional sense...</p>
<p>They all say that they are indecisive, quantum mechanics! Since the birth of quantum theory in human science, this sentence has often been used to explain some incomprehensible phenomena. After all, for many people, quantum theory is very esoteric, and they think that quantum theory can explain everything.</p>
<p>However, the truth is that concepts like quantum are not overly complex. When a physical quantity possesses the smallest indivisible fundamental unit, it becomes quantized, with this tiniest unit referred to as a quantum.</p>
<p>In simpler terms, quantum refers to the process of subdividing an entity to its irreducible point, where its fundamental components cannot be further divided. Starting from cells, then delving into nuclei, atoms, molecules, neutrons, protons, electrons, and so forth, this progression continues until reaching a point of indivisibility. At this level, the particle is commonly referred to as a quantum.</p>
<p>This is the cognition on the scientific side and similarly, there is also the cognition on the mysterious side that the element is also a kind of particle. With magic as a medium and catalyst, the element particles can also be combined at will. Split.</p>
<p>Certainly, within the realm of mystical theory, elemental particles are distinct from the molecular atoms of scientific understanding. They can be envisioned as particles formed through the amalgamation of various molecular atoms, collectively referred to as &quot;elements.&quot; While the nomenclature differs, these elements possess a nature akin to atoms and molecules, and they share the capacity for separation while maintaining similar fundamental properties.</p>
<p>So if the element particles are split until they can no longer be split, can they also be called quantum?</p>
<p>The answer is yes, Roy&#x27;s current situation is because all the element magic circuits in the body are completely integrated. To receive a coexistence, these elements undergo a spontaneous division, fragmenting into the most fundamental units of their composition. This transformation process even extends to Roy&#x27;s own body, altering its very nature.</p>
<p>It can be said that Roy’s body is now composed of the most basic units of the elements. These strange and mysterious mists are composed of trillions of elemental quantum. Roy escaped because of Roy&#x27;s soul and Mobius Mark pulling them.</p>
<p>The system panel refers to Roy’s state as a quantum demon for this reason. However, in the local name of the abyss demon, this form is called [Chaos Demon]...</p>
<p>Having said that, you may have guessed it, yes, it is precisely because all the elements are now in Roy&#x27;s body in a quantum state, so Roy can indeed use any elemental magic without any hindrance. Because elemental quantum can be transformed into any elemental magic!</p>
<p>Moreover, any elemental magic that Roy uses now will automatically obtain the extremely effective effects of various elements. To sum it up in one sentence, any magic he uses now can be a cataclysm!</p>
<p>After Roy explained his current state a bit, he demonstrated it to everyone on the spot.</p>
<p>Reaching out his index finger, which had no nails, Roy lightly pointed to a distant space in front of him.</p>
<p>&quot;freeze!&quot;</p>
<p>Two simple words, as Roy&#x27;s voice fell, the place he was pointing suddenly turned into a dark cube!</p>
<p>The darkness is so pure, but apart from that, there is no other vision. Compared with the magic used by Roy in the past, the effect is a bit simple and unpretentious. Such a dark cube stood there.</p>
<p>&quot;Foster father, what have you done?&quot; Sareth asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>The rest of the people also felt a little strange, feeling that Roy&#x27;s attack just now was in great contrast to his weird form at the moment.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of people who are more knowledgeable like Sparda and Benia, Roy&#x27;s actions just now are so terrifying!</p>
<p>&quot;Retreat, back away quickly!&quot; Sparda pulled Dante and Virgil, and Benia also pulled Julia and Sareth, quickly hiding back.</p>
<p>Amidst the bewildered gazes of those present, a sudden squeaking sound reverberated, signaling the commencement of the dark cube&#x27;s fragmentation. However, this fragmentation was not a conventional splitting but instead pertained to the space occupied by the dark cube—it began to crack! The sound itself emanated from the collapse of the space, not conveyed through the air but directly perceived by the consciousness of all individuals within this interconnected realm.</p>
<p>Under the horrified gaze of all present, the collapsed cubic space swiftly disintegrated and reassembled into a spherical shape. Gradually, it appeared to undergo relentless compression, growing smaller and smaller until eventually transforming into a diminutive black spot that vanished from sight.</p>
<p>&quot;This... what is that!?&quot; Sareth looked at Benia dumbfounded, hoping that Benia&#x27;s mother could explain to him.</p>
<p>But before Benia could speak, Sparda took a deep breath, and said solemnly, &quot;Your foster father... just frozen that space!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it&#x27;s frozen...&quot; Sareth just nodded, and suddenly reacted &quot;Wait, what did you say, Uncle Sparda? The space is frozen!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Benia nodded and took the conversation &quot;Not only space but also time is frozen, otherwise, there will be no such pure and terrible darkness! That is the sage of the kingdom of heaven. It is caused by the freezing of light. Without the movement and spread of light, we naturally can&#x27;t see anything with the naked eye!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Absolute zero in the true sense??&quot; Julia also reacted, in surprise &quot;Isn&#x27;t that the effect Osiris has been striving for? Previously, you had to concentrate deeply to achieve such a feat. Why is it happening so effortlessly now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the power of the Chaos Demon... It&#x27;s amazing.&quot; There was a light of excitement in Benia&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>Roy flew over to the two of them &quot;Absolute zero, the power that can freeze time and space together, the silence of all things, the temperature that ends everything, except for the power of the void and the power of authority. I am afraid that not many people can resist the move of the material world... If it were not for me to use the power of authority to limit the scope of the space to the cube, and after the space collapsed, let the rest of the space squeeze it into the void. If this is the case, I am afraid that the chain reaction caused can directly destroy the entire purgatory space of the heavenly kingdom... I did not expect to be able to do it so easily...&quot;</p>
<p>Dante, Virgil, Bayonetta, Jeanne, and everyone else were left dumbfounded, utterly astonished that such catastrophic consequences could arise from a seemingly ordinary strike. Fortunately, His Majesty the Demon King standing before them harbored no ill intent towards this world. Otherwise, the ramifications could have been unimaginable.</p>
<p>&quot;Foster father, you&#x27;re so amazing, you&#x27;re so handsome (even without face)!&quot; Sareth was already cheering.</p>
<p>Julia is smiling, sighing in her heart. From the time Roy became a high-ranking demon and she knew her, she felt that Roy had always been better than the demon of the same rank. To her surprise, even after ascending to the position of Demon King, she did not anticipate his relentless pursuit of further augmenting his power.</p>
<p>Such a powerful destructive force, even for the rest of the demon kings, it is not easy to achieve it, right?</p>
