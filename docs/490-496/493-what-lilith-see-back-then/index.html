    </h1>

<p>Benia was right. If Julia rushed forward just now, maybe Roy and her would be finished.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Julia was stopped by the calmer Benia...</p>
<p>To be honest, the sudden emergence of the void at this time was something that Roy did not expect. It is different from Benia’s understanding of the power of the void. In Roy’s understanding of the power of the void. The void is actually not that easy to erode a world, even if His method of tearing apart the two space bubbles is a bit rougher, and the same is true.</p>
<p>Void power is a chaotic and violent force dedicated to turning the material world into nothingness. It is the common enemy of all material worlds. It sounds terrible but in essence...</p>
<p>The void forces Roy has seen and contacted are manifested in the form of creatures or objects that erode and infect the material world, and then these infected people accelerate the destruction and destruction of the material world, even in the Darksiders World, The void in the Demon King City is so huge that it only eats up the space where the Demon King City is located bit by bit, and did not destroy it all at once. It can be seen that this kind of power has a special power. Lazy!</p>
<p>It is precisely because of this special inertia that most of the world can exist safely.</p>
<p>The void is like a piece of paper, or a black background board. Thousands of worlds and the universes and spaces that contain them are all depicted on this background board. Only when the universe and space of the world appear or only when it is damaged can you see the black on the background board, exposing the existence of the void.</p>
<p>These thoughts were all thought of in Roy&#x27;s mind for a moment, so he didn&#x27;t panic too much, but immediately mobilized the magic power of his whole body to protect himself, and at the same time observed these swarming void forces through the eyes of the godhead.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the power of the void, like black lightning, is now trying to corrode him. By infecting the creatures of the material world, the power of the void can survive in the material world. If the real Roy is corroded, then he will immediately Will be transformed into a void creature, even with his current rank, he will become a void lord, and then directly swallow these two twin worlds...</p>
<p>Fortunately, this erosion did not happen overnight, which naturally gave Roy a chance to breathe.</p>
<p>Roy now faces two choices. One is to give up and continue to separate the two purgatory spaces, and immediately escape and return directly to the abyss world, but the consequence of doing so is that this void fissure will never be closed, and it will continue to spray. Void power emerged, corrupting and eroding the two purgatory spaces, and then continued to spread to the human world.</p>
<p>Another option is to withstand the erosion of the void force and restore the two purgatory spaces to normal as soon as possible. In this way, the space storm will be calmed down, and the torn void gap will gradually heal, completely shutting down the void force. The escape route, and the consequence of this choice is that if Roy can&#x27;t withstand the erosion of the void power, he may be corrupted because of this.</p>
<p>As a demon, you don&#x27;t even have to think about it. It&#x27;s the first choice. Roy also thinks that his safety is first, and there is no need to carry it out for these two worlds.</p>
<p>However, just when he was about to withdraw and evacuate, suddenly, Roy found that all the magic loops on his body were pulsing.</p>
<p>With a move in his heart, Roy temporarily stopped his intention to evacuate, and quickly began to carefully perceive the magic circuit in his body.</p>
<p>He hasn&#x27;t forgotten what Lilith once said, only the power of chaos can fight the power of the void!</p>
<p>During the time in the abyssal world, Roy has been thinking about this issue. He thinks that Lilith’s words have a reason. If the void power represents &quot;nothing&quot;, then the elemental power represents &quot;thing&quot;!</p>
<p>Among the many theories of magic, the elements are the basis of the material world. This is recognized. No matter how special the material is, it cannot be separated from the evolution of the elements. A single element may only represent a part of the material world, but if Being able to gather all the elements can represent a complete material world, and here is the theoretical basis for chaotic power.</p>
<p>However, things like chaotic power may be easy to separate, but it is more difficult to regroup together. Roy has been trying to fuse these circuits since he opened up the magic circuits of all elements. But Roy himself didn&#x27;t know what went wrong. He can now use various element magic alone or cast some mixed element magic, but he has never been able to use all the element magic.</p>
<p>For so many years, there has been no progress, which made Roy have some doubts whether the so-called Chaos Force really exists.</p>
<p>Only at this moment, when Roy was accidentally exposed in a void in the rift and was corroded by the power of the void, he suddenly understand all the previous things!</p>
<p>[2] During Roy&#x27;s time in the world of Darksiders, he was merely a high-ranking demon. Although his strength improved rapidly when considering the lifespan of a demon, it still paled in comparison to Lilith, the demon king. In her eyes, his power was insignificant.</p>
<p>However, Lilith not only paid attention to it, but even entrusted Roy with a heavy responsibility, giving him the task to get the egg of the Red Sea, not to mention, she also explained the Chaos Demon to Roy in great mood.</p>
<p>At that time Roy didn&#x27;t think much when he arrived, but now looking back, Roy suddenly discovered that Lilith did this deliberately!</p>
<p>Lilith, in many legends, is a very special existence. She is the first female demon in the abyss world and the ancestor of the succubus family. Not only does she maintain a close relationship with all the demon kings, but she also have have relationship with Angles. It is said that Demon King Samael used to be an angel. It was precisely because of his marriage to Lilith that he left the Garden of Eden and came to the abyssal world to become a demon.</p>
<p>She is considered to be the first wife of the ancestor Adam of mankind. She is Eve, but she left the Garden of Eden because of dissatisfaction with Adam, and later became a female demon who seduced humans and strangled babies.</p>
<p>Even in some human folklore, she is the ancestor of vampires, the origin of vampires...</p>
<p>There are so many features that make it impossible to distinguish what kind of existence Lilith is. However, as far as Roy understands, the Lilith in the Darksiders world is undoubtedly very powerful, because she has The ability to control time!</p>
<p>Roy was very suspicious for a time. When Lilith saw herself, did she see something in the long river of time? so she liked herself so much...</p>
<p>Now, this suspicion has become a conviction. Because Roy discovered that under the tremendous pressure of the erosion of the void power, all the magic circuits in his body began to resist, and all the elemental powers in the magic circuits appeared at this moment. Signs of fusion!</p>
<p>Not a fusion of one or two, but a fusion of all elements!</p>
<p>It&#x27;s no wonder that when Roy tried on his own in the past, he couldn&#x27;t integrate all the elements. It turned out to be lack of special environmental conditions...</p>
<p>Roy no longer intends to run away. He knows that such an opportunity is simply a huge opportunity of a lifetime. The void rifts exposed are not huge, and the power of the void that swarms out has not reached the point where it is completely irresistible. Once he miss it, it may never encounter such unique environmental conditions again.</p>
<p>Therefore, Roy gritted his teeth and supported it, desperately urging the magic circuit in his body to operate, even if the whole body came from the maddening tearing pain, he did not care, but his eyes showed a touch of... fanaticism.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on! Lilith!&quot; Roy muttered to himself with difficulty &quot;If you really saw what happened to me in the long river of time, then it means that I must have a chance of success! Otherwise, you wouldn&#x27;t have said those things to me in the first place!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy doesn’t quite understand what the picture seen by Lilith, a prophet who can observe the future, looks like, but it should be countless possibilities, just like Doctor Strange in thousands of possibilities. Just as he found the only option that could defeat the Purple Sweet Potato Spirit, Roy felt that Lilith must have seen a similar picture, having successfully defeated the erosion of the void and gained the power of chaos.</p>
<p>What Roy has to do is to make this picture a reality!</p>
<p>Black lightning shrouded Roy&#x27;s body, violently radiating a terrifying and distorted scene around him. The Sparda in the distance had already been stunned at this moment. They could no longer see Roy&#x27;s figure, he could only see a huge black plasma ball floating there, endless auras of madness and destruction, constantly permeating from this black ball, even the ubiquitous soft holy light in the heavens was swept away by these auras .</p>
<p>&quot;If... I mean if...&quot; Dante swallowed hard, and said &quot;If Osiris is swallowed by some void power, does it mean the end is coming?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Benia glanced at him and said indifferently &quot;Doom! Everything in you and me, us, and even these two twin worlds will be completely erased, in the universe and the world, There will be no more information about us, as if it never existed...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s terrible!&quot; After listening to Sareth, his face was horrified. He couldn&#x27;t imagine the scene at all. He could only use such a word to describe his current mood.</p>
<p>Benia rubbed Sareth&#x27;s head and comforted him &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, at least when we disappear, it may not hurt too much, and we will disappear in a blink of an eye...&quot;</p>
