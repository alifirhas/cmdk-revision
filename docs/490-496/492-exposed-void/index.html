<p>Regarding the so-called &quot;authority,&quot; Roy himself remains uncertain about the nature of this power. He even speculates that even the deities who once wielded this power may have been unable to precisely define its true essence.</p>
<p>Certainly, by destroying those floating island wrecks before, Roy gains a rudimentary understanding of authority power. The pervasive &quot;strings&quot; that intertwine everything appear to represent a form of &quot;information&quot; or &quot;data&quot;. It seems that these strings serve as the fundamental essence of all underlying &quot;information&quot;.</p>
<p>They are the necessary basis for the formation of matter, weight, volume, external color, the influence caused by interaction with the outside world, and many other information. All this information is entangled together and forms node-like information... like the internet.</p>
<p>If Roy’s assumption is correct, these strings are technically the underlying information of matter. Then Mobius Mark gives Roy the key to &quot;seeing&quot; this low-level information. It is precisely because of the integration of the Mobius Mark that Roy was able to control this low-level information.</p>
<p>This sensation is akin to the Mobius Mark endowing Roy with the authority of an &quot;administrator,&quot; instantly elevating him to a position of power. In this regard, labeling this unique power as &quot;authority&quot; seems fitting indeed. <a id="fnref:1" href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>However, in the process of practical use, Roy still found some differences. This so-called administrator authority is not omnipotent!</p>
<p>Upon attempting to manipulate these strings, Roy discovered that he could only control a limited number of them at once. Many of the strings remained beyond his grasp, proving challenging to manipulate. Furthermore, these strings exhibited variations in their accessibility and difficulty levels, ranging from high to low.</p>
<p>This observation sheds light on the reason why individuals possessing authority over power exhibit distinct characteristics. In terms of human-computer analogies, it suggests that those with authority over power do not possess true &quot;admin administrator authority,&quot; but rather possess ordinary &quot;user authority.&quot;</p>
<p>The true &quot;administrator&quot; authority, in this analogy, would likely be attributed to the so-called creator. Such an entity would possess the ability to modify, create, and delete all information at will.</p>
<p>These speculations came from Roy&#x27;s imagination, drawing upon his previous human knowledge. Although Roy cannot ascertain their veracity, they align with his speculative understanding.</p>
<p>When experimenting with the power of authority, Roy made a significant realization. Unlike the archangel Jubileus, who possessed the ability to create strings of information seemingly out of nothingness, Roy, being a demon, lacked such creative capabilities. Instead, his influence lay in the capacity to dismantle and destroy these strings of information.</p>
<p><a id="fnref:2" href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref"><sup>2</sup></a> In other words, it seems that he can delete data, but cannot create it...</p>
<p>Roy is naturally unclear about the reasons behind this occurrence. He can only speculate that it is caused by his own demon body. After all, the power of the devil is always to dismantle and destroy, just as the creator created the demon to make them The same as the one to delete spam, the devil is the creator’s file shredder...</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also the destruction and destruction of the underlying data. Roy found that certain information was easy to delete and some were useless to even try. It took time and effort to carefully identify all of this information. Once he understands what the information is, Roy will also be able to understand what authority he controls.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Roy temporarily threw aside the mess of thoughts in his mind and began to concentrate on observing the world under his feet.</p>
<p>This fusion of the two purgatory spaces, as a whole, is the superposition effect of space. This superposition is invisible to the naked eye. Before merging with Mobius Mark, Roy was also powerless, but it is different now. With the help of authority, Roy’s field of vision can clearly distinguish the two types of string information that are present in the world with obvious differences. Now these strings of information are messily entangled like fishing lines. It deviates from what it should have been.</p>
<p>Although Roy does not have the authority to create, he still wants to separate the two spaces and does not involve anything that needs to be created.</p>
<p><a id="fnref:3" href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref"><sup>3</sup></a> Even though Roy lacks the authority to create, he possesses a degree of capability to separate the two spaces. This action, in essence, does not require authority to create. Correspondingly, he cannot delete and destroy the entangled spatial information at will. Roy has to untie the entangled information and sort them out to make them distinct and make the two spaces completely separated.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is a more troublesome process, Roy looked at the countless entangled string information and regretted it a little bit.</p>
<p>&quot;All of you give me a room and don&#x27;t disturb me. I need to concentrate!&quot; Roy said to everyone.</p>
<p>Sparda and the others nodded and dispersed, but they did not leave too far. Although the war is over, there are still sporadic angels in the kingdom of heaven. They need to guard against possible attacks by these angels and not let them disturb Roy.</p>
<p><a id="fnref:4" href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> The three pairs of demon wings behind Roy opened as he entered the state of true name liberation. In this state, he noticed that, apart from his fused Eyes of the Word, his entire body had transformed. It had grown larger, and even the wingspan had significantly increased. The three pairs of wings now extended widely, creating a sensation of dominating the sky...</p>
<p>In the state of true name liberation, Roy found that his ability to manipulate string information has become much easier. It seems that in the state of true name liberation, the growth of the soul also leads to the growth of the Eyes of the Word...</p>
<p><a id="fnref:5" href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref"><sup>4</sup></a> Roy&#x27;s nails, sharp as stainless steel, glimmered with a cold light in the diffuse heavenly glow. With his wings spread wide, Roy soared slowly along the border of tangled information, simultaneously brandishing these grotesque demons. Utilizing the authority imbued in his claws, he commenced dismantling the entangled information. The others lacked Roy&#x27;s Eyes of the Word, preventing them from perceiving the world he observed, thus peering at him curiously from a distance. His movements seemed like wild gesticulations to the air, creating an eerie sensation.</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t even think that his job would last for three days!</p>
<p>During this period, some defying angels attempted to attack Roy, but they were all intercepted by Sparda and others, allowing Roy to comb through information on both sides of the world without any distractions.</p>
<p>Three days later, when Roy finally sorted out the last string of information, he let out a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It’s very strange that when the two purgatory spaces overlapped, some bizarre phenomena often appeared in this heavenly world, but as Roy continued to sort out, these weird scenes became less and less. After Roy was completely sorted out, everyone saw a very obvious skyline appearing in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>The skyline before them is unlike the typical flat, two-layered skyline often observed. Instead, it takes on a peculiar and slanted form—a unique horizon that seems to bisect the entire celestial realm, dividing it in half.</p>
<p>This is a separation phenomenon that is unique to space. It is because the two purgatory spaces are not regular when they merge, so this kind of curvy marginal effect appears. On both sides of this line, one side belongs to the heavenly purgatory space, full of the soft power of holy light. On the other side belonged to the Demon world space, filled with dim ashes and storms.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is an unimaginable great spectacle, so much so that the angels and demons that still exist sporadically, like Sparda and them, all looked at the miraculous scene that subverted their imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;After sorting out, the next step is to separate the two purgatory spaces!&quot; Roy thought this way while flying on the skyline. Looking for nodes that he could grab with his hands when he found a place to apply force. After he found the node, Roy&#x27;s claws suddenly clenched, and the muscles of his arms swelled up like an explosion. The power of authority gathered in his palm, holding the two nodes, and he violently tore it!</p>
<p>A bang sound erupted as if it was coming from the entire space, instantly resounding in the minds of all the creatures in the purgatory spaces on both sides!</p>
<p>The space is torn apart!</p>
<p>And what appeared with this loud noise was a black crack in Roy&#x27;s location! Countless black lightning, like a shower, rushed out of the cracks and immediately enveloped Roy&#x27;s whole body.</p>
<p>Before everyone recovered from Roy&#x27;s feat of tearing the space apart, they saw this scene first, so Benia immediately looked shocked and couldn&#x27;t help screaming &quot;No! Osiris is in danger!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!? What is that!?&quot; Dante asked quickly after hearing Benia&#x27;s words.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the Void!!&quot; Benia said in a panic, &quot;I should have thought of the space bubbles in the two purgatory spaces, which originally existed in the void! There was nothing wrong with the previous two space bubbles fused. Now Osiris pushed the two spaces away and immediately exposed the void!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as she heard the word &quot;Void&quot;, Julia&#x27;s mind immediately buzzed, and the next moment she flew up in desperation, trying to rush to Roy&#x27;s location.</p>
<p>However, before she could take flight, Benia catch Julia and swiftly descended from mid-air. With concern, Benia exclaimed, &quot;Are you out of your mind!? Your action will only disturb Osiris !&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, what should I do!?&quot; Julia was anxious and shouted at Benia &quot;That&#x27;s our king! Our partner!&quot;</p>
<p>Benia also shouted at Julia &quot;If our Majesty can do nothing about it, what use is it for you to rush up?! Calm down, we can only trust him now, after all, now he has a Mobius Mark, maybe it can resist the erosion of the void power!&quot;</p>
<p>Dante and the others exchanged awkward glances as they observed Julia and Benia&#x27;s emotional state. Unfamiliar with the overwhelming power of the void, they failed to comprehend why Julia and Benia reacted with such fear toward the black lightning.</p>
