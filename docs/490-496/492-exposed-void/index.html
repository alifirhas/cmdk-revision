<p>For the so-called &quot;authority&quot;, Roy himself does not know what kind of power it is.</p>
<p>He even guessed that those gods who had mastered the power in the past were afraid that no one would be able to say exactly what this power should be called.</p>
<p>Of course, through the operation of destroying those floating island wrecks just now, Roy himself also vaguely had a little judgment of his own. This kind of &quot;string&quot; pervading everything seems to be some kind of &quot;information&quot; or &quot;data&quot;. Kind, but also the basic underlying &quot;information&quot;!</p>
<p>They are the necessary basis for the formation of matter, weight, volume, external color, and the influence caused by interaction with the outside world, etc. All these information are entangled together and form a string-like information. The internet.</p>
<p>If Roy’s guess is correct, these strings are really the underlying information of matter. Then the Eyes of the Word is the key that gives Roy the key to &quot;seeing&quot; these low-level information. It is precisely because of the integration of the Eyes of the Word that Roy is qualified to control these. Low-level information.</p>
<p>This feeling is as if the Eyes of the Word has given Roy the authority of an &quot;administrator&quot;, and Roy was promoted to the authority ​​at once [2]. In this sense, it is not to call this kind of power &quot;authority&quot;. It&#x27;s quite appropriate...</p>
<p>However, in the process of actual use, Roy still found some differences. This so-called administrator authority is not omnipotent!</p>
<p>He had tried to control these “strings” before, but found that many “strings” he could not move at all. The only ones that could be manipulated by Roy were only a few “strings”, and it was difficult to manipulate. There are also high and low.</p>
<p>This explains why every who has authority over power is different. If you put it in human computer terms, it is that every who has authority over power is actually not a real one. &quot;Admin administrator authority&quot; should be ordinary &quot;user authority&quot;.</p>
<p>The real &quot;administrator&quot; authority may be the so-called creator. He should have all the authority to modify, create and delete all information at will...</p>
<p>These are all speculations that Roy has imagined based on his previous human knowledge. Roy can&#x27;t tell whether this is the case, but the speculation is similar.</p>
<p>When experimenting with the power of authority, Roy discovered that he was unable to create these string information out of nothing like the archangel Jubileus did because of being a demon. What he could do, It is the destruction and destruction of these string information.</p>
<p>In other words, it seems that he can only delete data, but cannot create data...</p>
<p>Roy is of course not clear about why this is happening. He can only speculate that it is caused by his own demon body. After all, the power of the devil is always to destroy and delete, just as the creator created the demon to make them The same as the one to delete spam, the devil is the creator’s file shredder...</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also the destruction and destruction of the underlying data. Roy found that certain information was easy to delete, and some were more useless. It took Roy to spend time to carefully identify the specific information.</p>
<p>Once he understands what the information is, Roy will also be able to understand what the authority he controls.</p>
<p>Shaking his head, Roy temporarily threw aside the mess of thoughts in his mind and began to concentrate on observing the world under his feet.</p>
<p>This fusion of the two purgatory spaces, as a whole, is the superposition effect of space. This superposition is invisible to the naked eye. Before changing to the Eyes of the Word, Roy was also powerless, but it is different now. With the help of the Eyes of the World, Roy’s field of vision can clearly distinguish the two types of string information that are present in the world with obvious differences. Now these string information are messily entangled like fishing lines. It does not reflect the regular network structure of normal space.</p>
<p>Although Roy does not have the authority to create, he wants to separate the two spaces and does not involve anything that needs to be created. However, correspondingly, he cannot delete and destroy the entangled spatial information at will. Roy has to do It is to help untie the entangled information and sort them out to make them distinct, so that the two spaces can be completely separated.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is a more troublesome process, Roy looked at the countless entangled string information, and regretted it a little bit.</p>
<p>&quot;You spread out a bit, don&#x27;t disturb me, I need a longer time!&quot; Roy said to everyone.</p>
<p>Sparda and the others nodded and dispersed, but they did not leave too far. Although the war is over, there are still sporadic angels in the kingdom of heaven. They need to guard against possible attacks by these angels and not let them disturb Roy.</p>
<p>[3] The three pairs of demon wings behind Roy opened as he entered the state of true name liberation. In this state, he noticed that, apart from his fused Eyes of the Word, his entire body had undergone a transformation. It had grown larger, and even the wingspan had significantly increased. The three pairs of wings now extended widely, creating a sensation of dominating the sky...</p>
<p>In the state of true name liberation, Roy found that his ability to manipulate string information has become much easier. It seems that in the state of true name liberation, the growth of the soul also leads to the growth of the Eyes of the Word...</p>
<p>[3] Roy&#x27;s nails, sharp as stainless steel, glimmered with a cold light in the diffuse heavenly glow. With his wings spread wide, Roy soared slowly along the border of tangled information, simultaneously brandishing these grotesque demons. Utilizing the authority imbued in his claws, he commenced dismantling the entangled information. The others lacked Roy&#x27;s Eyes of the Word, preventing them from perceiving the world he observed, thus peering at him curiously from a distance. His movements seemed like wild gesticulations to the air, creating an eerie sensation.</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t even think that his job would last for three days!</p>
<p>During this period, there were also some defying angels who attempted to attack Roy, but they were all intercepted by Sparda, allowing Roy to comb through information on both sides of the world without any distractions.</p>
<p>Three days later, when Roy finally sorted out the last string of information, he let out a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It’s very strange that when the two purgatory spaces overlapped, some bizarre and weird phenomena often appeared in this heavenly world, but as Roy continued to sort out, these weird scenes became less and less. After Roy was completely sorted out, everyone saw a very obvious skyline appearing in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>This skyline is not the flat, two-layered skyline that we often see before, but a strange and slanted line, which is such a strange skyline, which brings the entire heavenly world into one. Split in half.</p>
<p>This is a separation phenomenon that is unique to space. It is because the two purgatory spaces are not regular when they merge, so this kind of curvy marginal effect appears. On both sides of this line, one side belongs to the heavenly purgatory space, full with the soft power of holy light. On the other side belonged to the Demon world space, filled with dim ashes and storms.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is an unimaginable great spectacle, so much so that the angels and demons that still exist sporadically, like Sparda and them, all looked at the miraculous scene that subverted their imagination.</p>
<p>&quot;After sorting out, the next step is to separate the two purgatory spaces!&quot; Roy thought this way, while flying on the skyline. Looking for nodes that he could grab with his hands, when he found a place to apply force. After he found the node, Roy&#x27;s claws suddenly clenched, and the muscles of his arms swelled up like an explosion. The power of authority gathered in his palm, holding the two nodes, and he violently tore it!</p>
<p>A bang sound erupted, as if it was coming from the entire space, instantly resounded in the minds of all the creatures in the purgatory spaces on both sides!</p>
<p>The space is torn apart!</p>
<p>And what appeared with this loud noise was a black crack in Roy&#x27;s location! Countless black lightning, like a shower, rushed out of the cracks, and immediately enveloped Roy&#x27;s whole body.</p>
<p>Before everyone recovered from Roy&#x27;s feat of tearing the space apart, they saw this scene first, so that Benia immediately looked shocked and couldn&#x27;t help screaming &quot;No! Osiris is in danger!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!? What is that!?&quot; Dante asked quickly after hearing Benia&#x27;s words.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the Void!!&quot; Benia said in a panic, &quot;I should have thought of the space bubbles in the two purgatory spaces, which originally existed in the void! There was nothing wrong with the previous two space bubbles fused together. Now Osiris pushed the two spaces away and immediately exposed the void!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as she heard the word &quot;Void&quot;, Julia&#x27;s mind immediately buzzed, and the next moment she flew up in desperation, trying to rush to Roy&#x27;s location.</p>
<p>However, before she could fly, she was hugged by Benia and rushed down from mid-air. Benia said to Julia &quot;Are you crazy!? You rushed over like this, instead of letting him Osiris not distracted!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, what should I do!?&quot; Julia was also anxious, and shouted at Benia &quot;That&#x27;s our king! Our partner!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If your Majesty has nothing to do with him, what use is it for you to rush up!?&quot; Benia also shouted at Julia &quot;Calm down, we can only trust him now, after all, now he has a Eyes of the Word, Maybe it has the ability to resist the erosion of the void power!&quot;</p>
<p>Dante and the others looked awkwardly at the emotional excitement of Julia and Benia. For them who did not understand the terrible power of the void, of course they would not understand why Julia and Benia would treat those black lightnings. So scared...</p>
