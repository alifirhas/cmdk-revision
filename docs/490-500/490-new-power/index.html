    </h1>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Eyes are the only way most creatures use to observe the world. However, in the eyes of different creatures, perhaps they observe the world differently.</p>
<p>Frogs are highly sensitive to moving objects in nature, but their vision is less clear when they are stationary. Most insects possess compound eyes, making it difficult to comprehend their visual perception. Snakes have limited vision but rely on thermal detection to locate prey. Human eyes can perceive a visual image of 576 million pixels and discern approximately 1 million colors, although color blindness and color weakness are common. The mantis shrimp, on the other hand, exhibits exceptional color discrimination ability, being capable of distinguishing up to 16 colors, including ultraviolet and infrared rays invisible to humans. Additionally, they can detect linearly and circularly polarized light. However, as the mantis shrimp lacks intelligence, it remains elusive to describe the world they perceive through their eyes...</p>
<p>All of this stems from the different eye structures between creatures.</p>
<p>Roy actually noticed a different eye structure from the moment he became a demon. At least when he was born as a human, he couldn&#x27;t see the soul at all, but as a demon, he could noticed. In addition, there is dark vision, the ability to see clearly in darker places is completely different from humans.</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s eyes have undergone a lot of evolution afterwards. Compared with other demons, he has more radiation vision. Therefore, the world scene that Roy sees in his eyes is naturally indescribable. But even so... the world he saw before and the world he saw after the integration of the godhead was completely incomparable!</p>
<p>As Julia and Benia stared in surprise, Roy&#x27;s forehead was centered on the center of his eyebrows, and a gap opened. The tough demon skin seemed to have been cut with a knife and it slowly spread to both sides, revealing A newly emerged demon&#x27;s eye inside.</p>
<p>The white part of the eye of this demon&#x27;s eye is entirely red, with a dazzling  feeling. Only the narrow and long pupil in the middle is covered with a touch of gold. The whole eye looks very strange, which makes people feel chilly and hassle. A strange sense of holiness...</p>
<p>Yes, a sense of sacredness! This word appears to be the most inappropriate adjective for creatures like demons, but it just appeared...</p>
<p>Because this newly-emerged vertical pupil is exactly the product of the fusion of the Mobius Mark godhead and Roy.</p>
<p>With the help of this eye, everything Roy sees at this moment has undergone tremendous changes.</p>
<p>This kind of change is difficult to describe in words. There are microscopic and macroscopic ones. In the microscopic view, Roy saw countless particles flooding the atmosphere, and these particles emit a completely different light. If you can identify them, Roy is very I quickly understand that these newly-appearing particles are actually elements! Endless elements flood the entire world, as if doing Brownian motion, colliding, merging, and then separating irregularly.</p>
<p>Roy raised his hand and attempted to use his magical power to condense a piece of ice in his palm. To his surprise, he witnessed an extraordinary force field emanating from his palm. However, upon contact with the force field, all the elemental particles, possibly including water, converged swiftly, gathering in his palm. Through a series of continuous squeezing, fusion, and meticulous arrangement, the invisible microscopic particles underwent a remarkable transformation into visible matter. Consequently, a diamond-shaped piece of ice materialized in the palm of Roy&#x27;s palm.</p>
<p>It was amazing. This kind of seeing the whole process of magic forming with his own eyes was simply too amazing for Roy. He had never thought that the magic he had released in the past was actually made in this way.</p>
<p>The unique force field formed by magic power was invisible to Roy in the past, but now, he deeply understands how the medium of magic power communicates elements. This was observed in a microscopic situation. Roy raised his head slightly and looked into the distance. The vertical pupil at the center of his brow shrank slightly, just like a magnifying glass was pulled away. Breaking out of the microscopic vision, Roy saw the macroscopic scene.</p>
<p>In addition to the world and colors observed in the past, there are many more things Roy can&#x27;t describe in the macro scene. It may be a special ray that was difficult to perceive in the past. Roy can&#x27;t tell for a while. Something, but the most special thing is that Roy saw... strings!</p>
<p>String, let&#x27;s call it that way, because it is composed of somewhat translucent, void, and ethereal threads. These countless threads are intertwined vertically and horizontally to form a sheet that covers the entire sky, and even covers the sky. The big net of the whole world!</p>
<p>This big net floods the world and makes all people and things shrouded in it, including Julia and Benia, who are close at hand, and there are many similar lines that seem to extend from their bodies. Coming out, it is the same as the countless threads intertwined in this world.</p>
<p>The reason why the word &quot;string&quot; suddenly comes to mind is because when Roy saw these misty threads, the first thing that came to his mind was puppets! Because the two of them looked like they were being caught in his eyes at the moment. Like puppets connected by countless wires...</p>
<p>&quot;What are these lines?&quot; Roy thought strangely, &quot;Could it be that these are the so-called lines of fate?&quot;</p>
<p>In some literary works, there are often such sentences and adjectives &quot;The goddess of fate has plucked the strings of fate&quot;. Roy didn&#x27;t think there was anything in this sentence before, but now he saw these illusory threads with his own eyes. Roy suddenly discovered that perhaps this sentence may be true.</p>
<p>There really is the so-called &quot;string of fate&quot;!.</p>
<p>Raising his hand, Roy saw that there were countless such strings extending from his body. These strings that swayed slightly like green smoke were intertwined with the strings that originally existed in this world, completely indifferent to each other.</p>
<p>In order to verify whether his guess was correct, Roy looked around and found that there was a broken floating island in the far horizon. It was a small piece of debris from the floating island of Heaven that was crushed in the previous war. There are still countless wires connected, so Roy raised his hand to release a huge group of destruction flames, completely destroying it.</p>
<p>However, after destroying the wreckage, Roy frowned, and thought &quot;It&#x27;s not right, it shouldn&#x27;t be like this&quot;. He clearly saw that the floating island wreckage itself spread after being destroyed. The string that came out has not disappeared, but changed to another form and continues to blend into the strings of this world.</p>
<p>&quot;What&#x27;s wrong?&quot; Julia and Benia didn&#x27;t know what was going on. They just watched Roy inexplicably raise his hand to destroy the wreckage of the floating island, but now they frowned, so Asked curiously.</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t answer them, but thought carefully for a moment, and suddenly looked at the wreckage of another floating island in the distance.</p>
<p>However, this time, Roy did not use magic, but tentatively reached out his hand. The five sharp fingers faced the wreckage and began to dance gently.</p>
<p>Julia and Benia dared not come out and watched Roy&#x27;s movements silently. Even Sareth and Dante Nero and the others came back and raised their fingers and hissed at them, beckoning them to be quiet. Don&#x27;t disturb Roy.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes, Roy seemed to have caught something, and the dancing fingers suddenly squeezed together. In the next moment, Roy saw the remains of the floating island with an area of ​​thousands of square meters in the distance suddenly cracked and turned into countless dust.</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t feel any magical fluctuations, nor any elemental invasion, but the wreckage was destroyed under the eyes of everyone. Julia and the others who saw this scene looked at each other, not knowing what was going on.</p>
<p>&quot;Foster father, what did you just do?&quot; Sareth asked curiously.</p>
<p>Roy did not answer him, but looked at his demon&#x27;s claws with some fascination, and muttered to himself &quot;So that&#x27;s the case, the power of disturbance? Or is this the so-called authority!?&quot;</p>
<p>No one knows what he did just now, only Roy himself knows. In fact, he has been trying to figure out a way to move the &quot;strings&quot; spreading out on the floating island. After trying for a long time, he finally found out. The root can let him &quot;pick&quot; the &quot;string&quot;, and when he grabs and directly breaks the &quot;string&quot;, the floating island is immediately destroyed!</p>
<p>In this feeling, it is really great! Roy can clearly feel that it is a supreme power!</p>
<p>After hearing Roy&#x27;s mumbling, Julia and Benia immediately revealed surprises in their eyes. Of course, they also knew that Roy was fused with Godhead, but they didn&#x27;t expect Roy to master it so quickly. The power of authority.</p>
<p>In the sky, four vigorous steeds came in the air, and the four horsemen of the apocalypse came slowly towards Roy on their respective mounts. Farther away, Bayonetta and Jeanne also stepped on their feet. The magical aperture is constantly jumping, rushing towards this side.</p>
<p>The previous self-detonation caused by Jubileus’s fall blows almost everyone away a long distance. Fortunately, this is heaven, with this vast empty space, so the power of self-detonation did not make everyone suffer. What a big injury, but the gap where they were blown out happened to be used by Roy and directly got the Eyes Of the World of Jubileus, so that the face of the war was very ugly at this time.</p>
<p>Eyes of the World is a good thing, but this kind of good thing falls into the hands of a demon, that’s another matter. Even if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were summoned by Roy, this doesn’t mean they would like to see Roy. A new Demon King is born.</p>
<p>So when the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse came to Roy, the first person in the war spoke with a stinky face &quot;demon, this is the only time and the last time, don&#x27;t think about using us to deal with the enemy for you!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy looked at him and grinned and said &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I also know that you will not do anything for me again. My promise is still valid. Next time you meet, you will face the ‘void’!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope so!&quot; War snorted, the four knights didn&#x27;t say a word, their bodies turned into four rays of light, and they disappeared into the sky in an instant. It looks like I can’t wait to return...</p>
<p>After seeing the four horsemen of the Apocalypse leave, Roy turned his head and looked at Sparda, Dante, Virgil, and Nero. The grandfather and grandson. At this moment, all of them are still in the form of demons, looking at Rpy with the same vigilance.</p>
<p>They certainly knew that Roy had merged with the Eyes of the World and became the new demon king, but the demon was the most difficult creature to trust. They didn’t know whether they were doing it right or not, but if Roy became the demon king, he wanted to treat these two The world is unfavorable, so their grandfather and grandson are fighting for their lives to stop Roy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Roy did not think about what to do with these two worlds...</p>
