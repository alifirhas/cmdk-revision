<p>The gate of the abyss in Frostfire City was made by Roy himself.</p>
<p>If Roy walked through the gate that other demon kings left behind in the abyss world, it might be better, but he walked through the gate of the city of Frostfire... because when he made the gate of the abyss, Roy still It’s just the rank of the demon lord, so he didn’t think too much at the time. The energy given to the gate of the abyss was only able to accommodate him passing through at that time, but he never expected that it was fine when he went, and when he came back it was upgraded.</p>
<p>It is not easy for a creature with extremely high energy in its body to pass through any door of space. The reason is, because its own energy often affects the stability of space. Now the upgraded Roy’s body The energy has far exceeded the expectations when the Abyss Gate was designed, which caused him to be stuck even if the Abyss Gate was expanded to the limit.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to be so stuck in the space tunnel, Roy has only one choice, and that is to use his power to directly break through the abyss gate and squeeze in forcibly, but this may cause the abyss gate to explode. Julia and other understood this and led everyone to evacuate Frostfire City.</p>
<p>&quot;I just don&#x27;t know how powerful the explosion will be. It would be better if only Frostfire City was destroyed. After all, the city could be rebuilt...&quot; Julia said with some worry &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that the explosion will be too powerful. The space is blown up, then... we can only find another habitat.&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Berial, the overlord of Hell, interrupted and said &quot;If I find another territory, then I still like places with flames and high temperatures. It&#x27;s too cold here...&quot;</p>
<p>This guy was a little bit ignorant about his words, so Julia and Benia stared at him fiercely before his voice hadn&#x27;t lost his voice.</p>
<p>It was originally, your boss Osiris is a Frost Demon, and the territory he is looking for must be a cold region. Even if you are a Fire Demon, you have to stay obediently...</p>
<p>In the eyes of everyone’s worry, the widened gate of the abyss began to twist. This distortion knew that it had entered an unstable state. They knew that Roy had begun to forcefully break through the gate of the abyss, so they retreated subconsciously. Much far away.</p>
<p>With the passage of time, the distortion of the gate of the abyss became more and more serious, and finally with a light &quot;pop&quot;, one of Roy&#x27;s arm finally pierced the space barrier and got out!</p>
<p>After the arm came out, Roy&#x27;s entire body squeezed out, but his series of actions also caused the space channel constructed by the gate of the abyss to be completely disintegrated, and the violent sound of kakaka spread throughout the entire space!</p>
<p>All of the buildings in Frostfire City were also affected by the cracking of space at this moment and a large number of cracks appeared. As if a photo was torn into countless fragments. Although these fragments are still gathered together, but it has been destroyed, and if nothing else, it will be completely turned into powder in the collapse of the space.</p>
<p>After Roy got out, he also discovered this. He originally wanted to try to save Frostfire City, but then found that the space fragmentation was spreading to the entire fragmented world. As a last resort, he could only find a way to keep the fragments. The world, as for Frostfire City, can no longer take care of that much.</p>
<p>So, after a while, Frostfire City, covering an area of ​​nearly a hundred kilometers, suddenly fell into a collapse. All the buildings, and even the ground nearly two kilometers below the surface, instantly turned into countless dust and particles, and in the space Under the contraction effect, they converged to a point in the center at once, and then disappeared completely.</p>
<p>The scope of the collapse of the entire space is a huge circle, so outside the scope of the collapse, there are very neat edge marks. The original city is gone, and only a huge round pit is left to indicate its original location...</p>
<p>Roy floating in the air like a mist, he was very relieved. It&#x27;s a pity that he can&#x27;t save Frostfire City but at least this fragmented world is protected by him, although his current bloodline is no longer limited to the Frost Demon. However, Roy still likes and adapts to this cold and quiet environment. Although there are a large number of fragmented worlds at the bottom of the abyss, it is not so easy to find a place with the same area as here...</p>
<p>After Julia and the others came back to rejoin Roy, those high-ranking demons who had stayed in Frostfire City were surprised to find that the strange demon in front of them was their former lord.</p>
<p>But then, they immediately felt the strong and coercive aura exuding from Roy&#x27;s body, an aura that would make them fall to the ground and shiver and worship.</p>
<p>&quot;Osiris has become a demon king!?&quot; After the upper demons were astonished, there was a thick surprise that followed, and they were going crazy with excitement!</p>
<p>A true demon king means more to demons than just the ruler. It can be said that every demon king is the idol of all demons. For the class concept of demons, if they obey a demon lord, then they may They will regard themselves as subordinates, but if they obey a demon king, then they will regard each other as master.</p>
<p>This is a completely different sense of belonging!</p>
<p>Therefore, after discovering that his lord was successfully promoted to the demon king, the demons who stayed behind in Frostfire City became extremely restless. A fever and excitement filled their bodies, which could only be heard Roaring and dancing to vent their emotions.</p>
<p>This led to the spectacle of demons dancing in Frostfire City at this moment...</p>
<p>Roy in the misty state looked a little speechlessly at the densely packed demons below, crying and howling, and didn&#x27;t understand what they were excited about.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear, are you okay?&quot; Julia and Benia gathered next to Roy and asked with concern.</p>
<p>Roy shook his head. He is in good condition now. The space burst and explosion just now looked quite dangerous, but in fact, it is not a big deal for him now.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the castle is about to be rebuilt.&quot; Sareth narrowed his mouth. &quot;Foster father, all my toys are gone...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The old ones don&#x27;t go, and the new ones don&#x27;t come!&quot; Roy stretched out the misty hand and pretended to rub Sareth&#x27; head twice, which was a comfort to him and made him smile again.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Cassandra looked at Roy thoughtfully and said, &quot;Master, will you always be like this in the future?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know, but...&quot; Roy looked down at his body and said, &quot;Theoretically, I should be able to simulate any appearance now... I need a little time to do it. There has been a huge change in abilities.&quot;</p>
<p>Benia nodded and said, &quot;Well, let us rebuild the territory next. You can concentrate on adapting to the various changes in your body. Besides...&quot;</p>
<p>She licked her tongue, charmingly said &quot;Hurry up and change back. I still like the way you were before the Frost Demon. I don&#x27;t want to have night activity with a cloud of smoke...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; Roy was also a little speechless when she heard it, and Benia was indeed a succubus, speaking straightforwardly.</p>
<p>&quot;Then i leave it to you!&quot; Roy looked around and said &quot;The city is gone. I will go down to the ground. The Demon Lord Beelzebub&#x27;s lair is a good place. I will stay there to adapt to my strength for a while. If you want to find me, go there and find me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Understood!&quot; Everyone nodded.</p>
<p>Then I explained to the four demon lords, Madam Styx and Berial, and asked them to find a place to settle down outside of Frostfire City, and allowed them to recruit their subordinates by themselves. After all, they are also demon lords and should be configured for them. The manpower still needs to be configured.</p>
<p>According to Roy&#x27;s vision, in the future, the four demon lords of them will guard the Frostfire City in the center from four directions, southeast, northwest, to highlight the status of the Demon King City.</p>
<p>After the explanation, Roy turned into a flowing mist and plunged into the ground.</p>
<p>The non-physical state of the body of the mist allows Roy to pass through any matter unhindered, and even all the particles in his body can bend in a stable space, thus achieving a more advanced skill than the [Flash] skill... [Space Displacement].</p>
<p>These are some of the ability changes that Roy is currently faintly experiencing, but it seems that it is far more than these. So after drilling into the ground, Roy went all the way, and soon came to the place where Beelzebub&#x27;s remains were discovered.</p>
<p>Back here, he used the power of the Red Sea Egg to fuse the legacy of Beelzebub, thus gaining the wind magic circuit and the power of the worm-type demon. A manifestation of vitality, it&#x27;s a pity that Roy hasn&#x27;t used this ability much, but he has already completed the promotion of the Demon King Rank.</p>
<p>The body of the mist is very handsome, very powerful and easy to use, but without a substantial body, Roy always feels a little uncomfortable, so he plans to study and study this time in retreat, perhaps through the help of the system, re-use Created by his original body.</p>
<p>Roy closed up, and Julia and the others did not disturb his tacitly. They turned their attention to the reconstruction of Frostfire City. Under their command, the enthusiastic and excited demons were working like a raging fire.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between day and night in the fragmented world, and the passage of time is naturally not so easy to detect. I don’t know how long it has been, half a year or a year. In short, when the reconstruction of Frostfire City was about to be completed, a figure suddenly appeared in In this fragmented world.</p>
<p>This is a strange...human being! He has the appearance of a kind old man, wearing a neat white suit, and he walks leisurely in the lonely and cold ice field. While walking, he looks at the surrounding scene with interest. Although he moves slowly, but His goal is very clear, that is, Frostfire City in the center of the ice field.</p>
<p>The first person to discover this human was Rafaro on the high-altitude orbit. When he found this figure, even Rafaro was shocked. This is the bottom layer of the abyss world, how could a human appear!?</p>
<p>Strange to strange, it issued a warning message for the first time, so it didn’t take long for the Hell Overlord Berial, who was guarding in this direction, to appear with a large number of demons, and surrounded the white suit on the ice field. Old human man.</p>
<p>Facing a large number of demons, the old human man still had a smiling face. When Berial saw him, he felt that something was wrong.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn&#x27;t be a real human...&quot; Berial held his blazing sword, looked down at the old human man, and sniffed vigorously &quot;You have a strong demonic aura...Who are you? This is the territory of His Majesty Osiris, what do you want to do here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Haha!&quot; The old human man smiled, tidied his suit with both hands, raised his head and looked at Berial and said &quot;I&#x27;m here to find your king, and his demon is called Osiris... it&#x27;s not a name. Wrong, please tell him, Mephisto is here!&quot;</p>
<p>Berial&#x27;s bull eyes widened suddenly &quot;Me... Mephisto!?&quot;</p>
<p>The cold sweat on his body came out at this time, and he was thankful that he didn&#x27;t act randomly when he came up to see the human appearance of the other party, otherwise, I am afraid that I don&#x27;t know how it is.</p>
<p>&quot;I...I&#x27;ll report...&quot; Berial hurriedly lowered his body, tried to reduce his sense of existence, and then turned his head, ignoring his demon&#x27;s men, desperately rushing towards Frostfire City.</p>
<p>And this old human man, who calls himself Mephisto, smiled kindly, and continued to move slowly with his hand on his back...</p>
