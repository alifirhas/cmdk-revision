<p>&quot;What are you talking about? Me... Mephisto???&quot;</p>
<p>After receiving Berial&#x27;s notification, the two mistresses, Julia and Benia, were a little confused for a while.</p>
<p>In the abyssal world, there are trillions of demons living, but only a dozen can stand at the top of the pyramid of the demons. Except for the first batch, the original sin demon representing the seven deadly sins. Besides Lilith, Queen of the Red Sea, there are actually several second-generation demon kings in the abyss world.</p>
<p>Unlike Roy, the demon king who just came to power, the second generation of demon kings have existed in the abyss world for a long, long time. This long time is at least calculated in units of ten thousand years. In such a long time, this The second-generation demon kings of the second generation naturally also gained a reputation among the ten thousand realms. Their resounding names are not only spread in the abyss world, but also spread throughout the human world and the heavens.</p>
<p>The angels of high-level heaven always don&#x27;t want to kill these demon kings all the time, but unfortunately, in the same long eternal battle, both sides will win each other and can only maintain a delicate balance.</p>
<p>As a result, with the passage of time, the achievements of the second generation of demons have also given them new titles.</p>
<p>Hate, lies, torture, pain, fear, sin, destruction, and the same titles with negative emotions, represent the highest honor of the abyss world. These seven second-generation demon kings are also in the eyes of the abyss world’s demons. Seven Sins Devil!</p>
<p>Among these seven new evil kings, Mephisto - the king of hatred, Baal - the king of destruction, and Diablo - the king of fear, there of them are the most famous!</p>
<p>Among the thirteen great demon kings recognized by the abyss world, they all occupy a seats. As for the king of lies, Belial and [2] Andariel, they are more controversial...</p>
<p>However, in the last few thousand years, it has been difficult to see these seven new sin kings in the abyss world. It is said that among the news spread by the demons, these seven new sin kings seem to have fallen into a super high world. It&#x27;s hard to get out, and stuck directly...</p>
<p>Arriving at the ranks of the demon king, it is almost impossible to kill the soul forever, but it is difficult to be killed, but it does not mean that it will not be sealed. If the demon kings encounter powerful archangel high-level enemies, it might not be possible. It’s also going to roll over. The Abyss World once had the Demon King being sealed by a single seal for tens of thousands of years. Therefore, even if it is difficult to see the traces of the activities of a few new Sin Demon Lords in the Abyss World, the demons did not think it was a big deal. After all, they still have to live their respective lives.</p>
<p>When Roy met Rodin in the world of Devil May Cry before, Rodin called himself Mephisto. Since he dared to call himself this way, it means that Rodin is a clone of Mephisto, but this matter is only Roy and Rodin. [3] Roy didn&#x27;t mention it to Julia and the others afterwards, so when they heard the name suddenly, Julia and Benia seemed so surprised.</p>
<p>In order to welcome the arrival of the veteran Demon King Mephisto, Frostfire City immediately rushed out, and the four demon lords, plus Julia and Benia, came to greet Mephisto with many demons.</p>
<p>At the same time, they also asked Sareth to quickly call Roy back.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, not bad!&quot; When he came to the gate of Frostfire City, Mephisto had a walking cane in his hand. He looked very gentleman. He held the walking cane with his hands and stopped and looked at Frostfire city, constantly nodding praise.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Majesty Mephisto, we welcome your arrival...&quot; Julia and Benia knelt on one knee, and respectfully said to Mephisto with everyone &quot;I wonder if you are here this time...?&quot;</p>
<p>Mephisto, who looked like a human, glanced at Julia, a golden-red light flashed in his eyes, and seemed to use some power to observe Julia, and then said with a little surprise &quot;So it&#x27;s you... My child, your power has gone a step further. It looks like the soul of Archangel Jubileus, you really have almost digested it!&quot;</p>
<p>Julia was stunned for a while, wondering how Mephisto knew about it, but she cleverly didn&#x27;t say anything.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems that I really came right this time...&quot; Mephisto said to himself, and then he continued to walk into the city with his walking cane, while walking with Julia and following from behind. Mephisto said &quot;I&#x27;m here to find your new king, Osiris. I wonder if he has time to meet my old man?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When... Of course, we have sent someone to notify him that he is here...&quot; Benia replied in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, you Lilim is not bad too!&quot; Mephisto looked back at Benia when he heard the words, and nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>Lilim is another name for succubus, which means daughter of Lilith. The succubus has this name for the entire race, but nowadays such a name is rare, only those older demons, still maintaining this tradition of calling succubus. Benia immediately realized that Mephisto in front of her might really be the old monster of the abyssal world...</p>
<p>After entering Frostfire City, Mephisto was not polite. He went around to visit, and then sat down in the castle hall, next to the throne. He carefully placed the staff of civilization beside him. By the way, he also tidy up up his meticulously managed hair, as if preparing for the meeting.</p>
<p>If you ignore your current position and say that Mephisto is a real human gentleman, someone will definitely believe it...</p>
<p>He waited quietly, while Julia and Benia were filled with unease. Mephisto had arrived alone. Although it was unlikely that he had ill intentions, the abyss world had always warned that one demon king should not encounter another, for the nature of the devil made it difficult to predict the outcome when two demons of such high stature meet. It was true that no one could guarantee it would turn out well...</p>
<p>&quot;I hope they don&#x27;t fight... Frostfire City has just been rebuilt, if it is destroyed again, it will be a problem...&quot; Julia and Benia whispered to themselves.</p>
<p>The waiting time is a bit long, but Mephisto has been waiting very quietly. I don&#x27;t know how long it has passed. A smile suddenly appeared on his face, he stood up and said, &quot;Here&quot;.</p>
<p>In the next second, countless mists emerged from the space, and finally gathered into Roy&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>The volume of the fog was so large that after Roy appeared, he looked at Mephisto condescendingly, but Mephisto was not at all annoyed, but looked up at Roy&#x27;s body with interest.</p>
<p>Roy was also a little surprised when he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. Sareth didn’t say anything clearly when he hurried to find him, so he saw Mephisto’s human appearance. At first glance, Roy felt that his eyes were blurred.</p>
<p>&quot;Ha, little friend Osiris, we meet again!&quot; Mephisto opened his arms with a smile, looking forward to a hug.</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; Roy was silent for a while, and then reacted, so the misty body shook and shrank, and quickly condensed the same human appearance.</p>
<p>He looks like an oriental with black hair and eyes, but strangely his facial features and appearance are a little fuzzy.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is what Roy looked like when he was a human. During the period of retreat, he was finally able to control his foggy body to simulate other images. Now I see that Mephisto is also a human. He naturally subconsciously imitated his original appearance.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just... because it&#x27;s been a long time, Roy doesn&#x27;t even remember what he was like at the beginning, so he has become such a vague look. Only the black hair and black eyes are very clear...</p>
<p>Seeing Roy also turned into a human appearance, Mephisto looked a little surprised, but then immediately laughed again and said to Roy &quot;Look, we actually have a common language, don&#x27;t we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You... got Rodin&#x27;s memory?&quot; Roy asked Mephisto while adapting to this human body &quot;Across time and space so far, can you still be able to connect with your clone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right!&quot; Mephisto nodded, but then sighed &quot;But it&#x27;s just a memory. Those clones have formed their own independent personalities over the long years, and they have even been completely connected to those worlds. Linked together, I am no longer willing to return to the ontology...&quot;</p>
<p>Roy nodded and didn&#x27;t speak. When he first met Rodin, he discovered that Rodin&#x27;s clone actually already had the power of the Demon King rank. In such a situation, it is really hard to tell who is the clone and who is the main body.</p>
<p>Just like Julia, you would say that she is a clone of Jubileus, that&#x27;s correct, but now that she gradually merges Julia&#x27;s soul, then she becomes the body instead.</p>
<p>Within the Ten Thousand Worlds, numerous opportunities and potential dangers exist, and Roy has learned to exercise caution. Over time, ancient demons and angels have shown him the consequences of carelessness. As a successor, if Roy fails to internalize these lessons, he would truly be foolish.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Roy walked to the throne in the hall and sat down, tilted his head and looked at Mephisto, motioning for him to also sit down, and then said &quot;No wonder Rodin told me at the time that we would meet again soon. It seems that at that time he shared the memory with you in the Book of Changes, right? So, you really are the ontology?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who knows?&quot; Mephisto&#x27;s face suddenly showed a weird grin. It wasn&#x27;t until this smile appeared that people could feel his non-human identity. He smiled and said &quot;Perhaps I think I am the main body, but actually Maybe I&#x27;m a clone too...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Ma, the avatars are all crazy!&quot; Looking at Mephisto&#x27;s appearance, Roy couldn&#x27;t help complaining inwardly &quot;Where is the devil, it is simply a schizophrenic...&quot;</p>
<p>Mephisto’s incarnation has so many images in the world, so that no one knows what his real body looks like, so no one can say whether the body in front of him is his body. Okay. Roy didn’t struggle too much, and he said directly “I thought Rodin said, I’m afraid it will be a couple of hundred years later. I didn’t expect you to find it so soon. Let’s talk about it. whats the matter?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m here this time, first, to see you, the newly promoted Demon King, after all, the Abyss World has not given birth to a new Demon King Order for a long time...&quot; Mephisto said slowly &quot;The second is, I want to invite you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Invite me?&quot; Roy looked at him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, invite!&quot; Mephisto nodded, his tone of bewilderment was gradually brought into his voice, and said &quot;I believe you have discovered it too. After becoming the Demon King Rank, although his power has become extremely powerful, he is correspondingly strong. It’s becoming more and more restricted. The worlds you’ve been to before can now pass through the gates of the abyss, right? So, do you want to be free from such obstacles?&quot;</p>
<p>[4] Rather than responding to the conversation, Roy fixated his gaze on Mephisto&#x27;s persuasive expression for a moment before breaking into a smile. &quot;Of course, I desire unhindered access to the Ten Thousand Realms, but wouldn&#x27;t it be a good solution to simply locate those high-energy worlds on my own? Why do I need your invitation?&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Name Changes:
<ul>
<li>Belie -&gt; Belial
<ul>
<li>Belie has been changed to Belial, who is known as the King of Lies in The Demonic Paradise and also appears as Lord Belial in Mairimashita! Iruma-kun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Civilized rod -&gt; Walking Cane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regarding a close name for Andariel, considering the exclusions of Demon Kings that has been mentioned (7 deadly sins, Mephisto, Baal, Diablo, and Belial), there are three potential options: Astaroth, Abaddon, and Azazel. Choosing among them is challenging. However, let&#x27;s exclude Leviathan from the question.</li>
<li>There are instances where the pronoun &quot;I&quot; appears frequently, but it very out of context.</li>
<li>The meaning of this paragraph kinda lost, but the overall idea is that Roy is skeptical about Mephisto&#x27;s invitation to join him in overcoming obstacles when traveling to other worlds. I rewrite it tome make it more readable.</li>
