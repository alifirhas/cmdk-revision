    </h1>

<p>In the dark, deep and silent bottom world of the abyss, fragmented spaces move randomly like Brownian motion.</p>
<p>Only when you enter these fragmented spaces will you know that there are different small worlds. Some of these small worlds may be as small as a few squares of land, but some can be large enough to accommodate several cities.</p>
<p>The fragmented world at the bottom is a world that belongs to the survival of upper demons alone. Those who can enter and leave here are at least at the upper demon rank. However, the upper demons can only be regarded as residents here. The real ruler here is It&#x27;s the demon lord!</p>
<p>No one knows how many demon lords exist in this fragmented world, but there is no doubt that every relatively large fragmented world may be the territory of a demon lord. The demon lords use their own powerful power. They protects these fragmented worlds, while at the same time fighting for territory with other demon lords openly and secretly. The winner is stronger and the loser dies. The cruel rules of the abyss world are also vividly reflected here and this over ten million years is the main melody in this fragmented world...</p>
<p>In recent years, among the demons in the Fragmented World, there has been news that a new Frost Demon Lord was born. This Frost Demon Lord named Osiris has occupied a huge ice habitat in the Fragmented World as a Territory, and was victorious in disputes with several other demon lords.</p>
<p>For some demons who have lived for a long time, this is about two thousand years. They have heard the news that the Frost Demon has become a lord again. These ancient demons will sigh with emotion even when they gather in private. Let’s jokingly explore why the Frost Demon hasn’t used the topic of extinction...</p>
<p>Why is there such a discussion? That’s because the demon who are more informed know that in recent years, there has been a special and powerful demon force that is capturing the Frost Demon group. As for what this demon force is doing to capture the Frost Demon, they actually don’t know much about it. They just know that the Frost Demon who was captured has never returned to the Abyss World...</p>
<p>So under this circumstance, the newly promoted Frost Demon Lord looks a bit different and unique, so that some other Demon Lords are considering whether to find the location of the Frost Demon Lord first? In their opinion, it is estimated that this Frost Demon Lord will be captured by that group of demon forces in a short time, and then his territory will be able to take over in a logical way?</p>
<p>As for whether that group of demons can really capture a Frost Demon Lord, no one has ever doubted it, because anyone who has been in contact with this group of demons understands how terrifying the power behind this group of demons is...</p>
<p>Calculating the time, it seems that demons will reappear in the abyss world soon...</p>
<hr />
<p>Frostfire City, Roy&#x27;s territory, the surface world here is still howling cold, the extremely harsh cold even the devil can hardly bear, so that almost no living creatures can be seen moving on the surface.</p>
<p>But in the very deep place below the surface, there is an uncharacteristically fiery scene. A large number of demons are working here. They squat their bodies and use their sharp devil&#x27;s claws to dig through the soil, looking for it. The fiery red flares exuding high temperature, after mining these flares, they piled the flares into the cart pulled by the demon worms. The powerful bodies of the demon worms can even pull them at once. Dozens of tons of ore, when the demon worm pulls these ore to the side of the underground river flowing with lava, it will arch its body and pour the flares ore into the magma river.</p>
<p>The high temperature of the magma river can make preliminary refining of the ore. Impurities and soil will melt in the river, and the flares that can withstand the high temperature will emit a stronger red light and move slowly under the flow of the river. After arriving at the second location of the mine, there will be flying fire demon salvaging these flares. After loading the truck, the demon worm will pull it back to the surface and store it in the warehouse.</p>
<p>This kind of mining looks orderly, and it is completely invisible that this is an ore mining base in charge of demons, but this is the case. Low rank demons are more obedient after being dominated by upper demons. The other creatures are much taller, because they are used to executing the orders of upper demons...</p>
<p>Even during Roy’s absence, the mining work here has not been affected in any way, but recently the high-ranking demons who are responsible for guarding the warehouse are a little worried. The cause of this worries is the flares are about to be mined. The warehouse is full, but the lord has not yet returned. They don’t know whether to continue to expand the warehouse or find a way to trade these flares...</p>
<p>The demons are good at fighting and fighting, but it’s a bit difficult for them to do things like trading. Among the thousands of demons, they may not be able to find a few countable...</p>
<p>Just when the upper demons were thinking about it, the gate of the abyss arranged in Frostfire City finally moved. The breath that belonged to the gate of the abyss was spreading, and the upper demons who felt this breath reacted immediately. This is the opening of the gate of the abyss, and it must be the Lord, Lord who has returned!</p>
<p>As a result, the high-ranking demons in the management immediately flew towards the main castle, preparing to welcome the return of their lord Osiris.</p>
<p>However, when they rushed to the gate of the abyss, they discovered that the area and area of ​​the gate of the abyss were unprecedentedly huge this time! The height alone has reached several thousand meters, and the area covered almost covers most of Frostfire City!</p>
<p>Such a huge gate of the abyss had never been seen by the upper demons before. They raised their heads in astonishment to look at the gate of this ultra-standard abyss, not knowing what had happened.</p>
<p>But soon, one figure after another appeared from the gate of the abyss. The upper demons quickly recognized the two first mistresses, Lord Julia and Lord Benia, then they also appeared behind them. Cassandra the Lich, and Sareth.</p>
<p>It was indeed the Lord who had returned. The upper demons woke up and hurriedly flew forward to greet them.</p>
<p>However, Benia sternly warned &quot;Don&#x27;t come over, all back!&quot;</p>
<p>Not only were they warning them, the two mistresses were also bringing people who came out of the gate of the abyss quickly to widen the distance from the gate of the abyss, as if something went wrong with this huge gate of the abyss.</p>
<p>The upper demons could only follow quickly. When they flew beside Julia and Benia, they discovered that there were more figures in the team that they didn&#x27;t recognize.</p>
<p>One of the female demons is flying in the air. Behind her are two huge butterfly and phoenix-tailed wings. Black and purple powders are scattered along with her flying trajectory. Just being contaminated with these powders makes the upper demons painful. It can be seen that the powder is a kind of highly toxic substance at all.</p>
<p>The male demon beside him was a massive fire bull, exuding a majestic presence. Flames engulfed his expansive wings, while he wielded a colossal sword of fire. Despite his imposing demeanor as a hell master, he now appeared panicked as he followed closely behind Lord Julia, swiftly making their escape through the abyssal gate.</p>
<p>In addition to these two demons, there are two other demons. Although they are smaller in size, there is no doubt that they both exude a strong aura.</p>
<p>The upper demons in Frostfire City looked at these four demons with trepidation. They were not ignorant people, and they could see that they were four demon lords behind Lord Julia and Lord Benia. !</p>
<p>What happened? Why did Lord Osiris go to a certain world from the Gate of the Abyss, and then suddenly four more Demon Lords came back after returning!?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the upper demons are not stupid. They feel strange, but they can still see that the four more demon lords belong to their side. They dare not say anything, they can only flee in confusion...</p>
<p>[2] A group of individuals soared through the air while Fat Tiger&#x27;s massive figure sprinted diligently on the ground not far behind. Fat Tiger had just returned from his journey to the world of Devil May Cry. Trailing behind him was a smaller hellhound, known as Cerberus. Desperately pursuing Fat Tiger, Cerberus&#x27;s three heads would occasionally lean forward to catch a whiff of Fat Tiger&#x27;s tail, after which all three dog faces would display a mischievous smirk...</p>
<p>In the higher altitudes, Rafaro’s figure is flying. Compared with before going to Devil May Cry, his body has grown larger and slender again. This is because of the centipede lord method that Roy will kill. Scolopendra soul was taken from Frostmourne, and it was swallowed by Rafaro. It can be said that Rafaro now also has the same power as the Demon Lord.</p>
<p>The four demon lords who were already under command, along with Rafaro and Julia, born from the merger of Julia and Benia, brought the total number of demon lords under Roy&#x27;s authority to six.</p>
<p>If Roy had not become a demon king now, he would have been a bit difficult to manage this group of demon lords...</p>
<p>After Julia and Benia had escaped and stopped for a long time, they turned around with lingering fear and looked at the ultra-standard abyss gate that appeared in Frostfire City.</p>
<p>&quot;How could this happen?&quot; Julia said madly &quot;The gates of the abyss have expanded into this way, why is Osiris still stuck!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No way, his current strength is too strong...&quot; Benia said helplessly and proudly.</p>
<p>Yes, no one would have thought that the first problem Roy, who had been promoted from the crown to the majesty after returning to the abyss world, turned out to be that he was stuck by the abyss gate...</p>
<p>This is a bit embarrassing...</p>
