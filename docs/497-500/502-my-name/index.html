<p>After staying for most of the day, Mephisto left Roy&#x27;s territory with satisfaction. Mephisto&#x27;s purpose of this trip was achieved, Roy agreed to him, planning to go to the world of Diablo.</p>
<p>After Mephisto left, Julia and Benia came to Roy&#x27;s side, worryingly &quot;My dear, are you really planning to go to that world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why? Worry about me?&quot; Roy stretched out his hand and raised Julie&#x27;s chin, smiling.</p>
<p>He still maintains a human form, so this smile doesn’t look hideous, but rather gentle. This made Julie a little confused for a while, but she quickly recovered and said, “Of course I’m worried, because I always I think Mephisto seems to be pitting you!&quot;</p>
<p>The word pit was still learned by Julie from Roy, but when used here, she felt that the word was appropriate this time.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I know that he wants to pit me!&quot; Roy snorted coldly, stood up from the throne, the mist on his body was tossing, and he turned back to the previous demon form, but the wings behind him were not the same as the previous three. Yes, but in a pair, this pair of wings are not conventional bat wings, but reverse wings like Samael.</p>
<p>Benia came up a little fascinated, and stretched out her hand to caress Roy&#x27;s reverse wing. Compared with her own reverse wing, Roy&#x27;s reverse wing appeared more sturdy and huge, and the hard texture was hard and full. The characteristics of a male demon, so Benia touched Roy&#x27;s body while stroking her calf.</p>
<p>Roy embraced her, kissed her fiercely, and then continued to speak &quot;Hmph, some of their ancients, old demon kings are all trapped in that world, why should I add another demon king in? Will he be able to solve the predicament? Mephisto came to me because he felt that I had just been promoted to the Demon King rank and when I was very proud, I would be easily fooled by him. Even though he kept saying that it was an angel united. Humans cheated them, but in my opinion, that world is definitely more dangerous than what he described.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why are you still agreeing to him?&quot; Julie came up and stroked Roy&#x27;s chest with Benia, feeling aggrieved &quot;Is it really because of Lilith? Is it possible? Don’t we two compare to Lilith?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Lilith is just one of them, and it&#x27;s not what you think. I have never had any interest in Lilith!&quot; Roy shook his head and said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know Lilith in that world is about to come, and Lilith in the Diablo world. In the end, who is the subject and who is the clone between the silks, but from Mephisto’s situation, there must be a connection between the two. I don’t plan to go to the world of dark blood anymore. After all, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The matter has not been resolved, so I can only go to the world where they are in Mephisto. I think if there is a connection between the two Lilith, then she must still remember me. I want to ask her in person. In the long river of time, what kind of picture did I see...&quot;</p>
<p>There are too many secrets hidden in the body of Lilith, the Demon. The Egg of the Red Sea that Roy brought back at the time seemed to be taken away by Lilith deliberately. Otherwise, it would be easy for Lilith to want to go back. But she didn&#x27;t say anything, or even mentioned it.</p>
<p>Mephisto said that the egg of the Red Sea is Lilith’s placenta. Whether this sentence is true or false is unknown, but Roy has always had a guess that he thinks this thing should be the legacy of the creator, just like he brought it back. Like those demon bible steles, the old demon kings may at best be the first holders or users, but they are not the true creators.</p>
<p>Now, Roy does not possess all the Demon Bibles. Perhaps he can find others in the world of Diablo this time... This is the second reason why Roy agreed to Mephisto.</p>
<p>Consider this: the world of Diablo now brings together Mephisto, Baal, Diablo, and the upcoming Lilith. This means there are four demon kings present. If we include Baal, Azmodan, Andariel, and Duriel as the remaining four demon king ranks, there would be a total of eight demon kings. With so many demon kings gathered in one place, it is highly improbable that any of them would not possess a demon bible.</p>
<p>As for the last reason, it is related to Roy&#x27;s own authority.</p>
<p>During the period of retreat, Roy has been studying the power of authority. This power that can manipulate the underlying information is a very new thing for him. However, during the research, Roy discovered that magic does not seem to be The best medium to drive the power of authority!</p>
<p>As a demon, even if Roy has obtained the Eyes of the World and has the authority, his authority and power also tend to destroy and demolish. Like other demon kings, he has the ability to destroy a thing and an object from any level. Example for this &quot;Any level&quot;, if you want to destroy a stone, you can smash it with a hammer, or you can throw it into the fire to melt it. These are all ways of destruction, Roy’s authority and power. It destroys it from the information level, such as directly changing the force between the stone molecules to make the stone become powder by itself or or directly changing the density of the stone to make it collapse inwardly.</p>
<p>Everything in this world can be said to be strong and stable, but it can also be said to be extremely fragile, because once the many pieces of information that make up things are tampered with or removed, they will immediately lose stability and be destroyed.</p>
<p>This is the mighty power bestowed by the Eyes of the World on the demon kings and gods. Roy once suspected that the power of this authority was the original power of the Creator. It was only after the demons and angels that they were divided into two, and the demons had the information of destruction. And the angels have the power to create information...</p>
<p>And when Roy had such an idea, he suddenly thought of Lilith. Lilith created the [2] Nephalem. Could it be that he wanted to reconcile the authority of the demon and the angel and reproduce the power of the Creator!?</p>
<p>In other words, she wants to recreate the Creator!?</p>
<p>To be honest, Roy was shocked when he thought of this, and Lilith&#x27;s sense of mystery in his eyes deepened...</p>
<p>With the passage of time, Roy discovered in the process of studying the power of authority that, among the many ways of destruction and destruction, his best at, or the best way to manipulate, turned out to be temperature! Extreme temperature!</p>
<p>This might be attributed to Roy being a frost demon. He has realized that he can manipulate the temperature of objects at will. He has the ability to lower the temperature to absolute zero, as well as raise it to a scorching 100 million degrees Celsius, akin to nuclear fusion temperatures at the time.</p>
<p>However, it is not a simple task to bring objects to these two extreme temperatures. While it is theoretically possible to employ magic as a conduit, the process remains highly enigmatic. Whether it involves reaching the high temperature of absolute zero or 100 million degrees, an immense amount of magic power is necessary. Even as Roy now holds the title of Demon King, his resources are still limited. After extensive study, Roy started contemplating whether magic is truly the most effective catalyst to harness the power of authority.</p>
<p>Naturally, such thinking is to be expected, as magic has always served as the means to cast spells and has been considered the optimal catalyst and medium for channeling magical energy and the power of authority. However, upon deep contemplation, Roy was struck by an original idea.</p>
<p>Before he became a demon king, he had imagined the power of the demon king. He believed that emotions should also be a kind of regular power. However, after becoming the demon king, he discovered that what the Eyes of the World gave him was not the use of the power of the rules of emotion, but information.</p>
<p>However, why is every demon of the Demon King&#x27;s rank given the name of mainly negative emotions?</p>
<p>Does this mean that for the demon, the power of this negative emotion is the best medium for urging authority?</p>
<p>Roy believes that his guess should be correct. You must know that when the soul contains negative emotions, such souls are the most delicious for demons. The long-term pursuit of these negative emotions by demons can be said to be related to life. The inherent instinct, perhaps this instinctive pursuit, is to prepare for becoming a demon king after taking power...</p>
<p>So Roy asked himself What kind of negative emotion is the power I use to drive authority? What kind of name will I be called the demon?</p>
<p>All of this can only be found by going to the human world, because... Human beings are the most emotionally powerful species among all intelligent creatures. Since Mephisto has arrived, it is just right to follow the water and go to the world of Diablo and use the human beings in that world to find your own emotional power!</p>
