<p>Facing Mephisto&#x27;s so-called &quot;invitation&quot;, Roy&#x27;s first reaction was to be vigilant.</p>
<p>Although Mephisto is not such a guy as Belial the Lie or [2] Kil&#x27;jaeden the Deceiver. If you really think that the Lord of Hate can&#x27;t lie, then you are quite wrong. Like Mephisto Such an old &quot;demon&quot; can&#x27;t say whether one of the ten sentences is true or not.</p>
<p>So Roy didn&#x27;t plan to pick up his topic at all, saying &quot;Which world I&#x27;m going to has my own plans, so I won&#x27;t bother you!&quot;</p>
<p>What he said was not at all polite, but Mephisto was not at all annoyed, still smiling kindly, and said &quot;Young man...As a new demon king, I call you a young man. Pass it? After all, I only have the qualifications to boast about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where! You are more than just an old qualification?&quot; Roy also smiled humbly and said &quot;The name of Mephisto, the king of hatred, can shake the abyss world just by saying it, you are too humble.&quot;</p>
<p>Mephisto waved his hand and sat back on his seat, with the walking cane sticking in front of him, and slowly said &quot;Osiris, you are a newly grown demon, so you may not be able to deal with some situations in the abyss world. I know that about tens of thousands of years ago, most of us Demon Kings still stayed in the Abyss World. During that period, we conquered each other and competed for territory. It was funny. At that time, the Abyss World Basically, our group of demon kings fighting against the war... not like it is now, only the demon lords are fighting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Roy asked curiously, &quot;Why is this?&quot;</p>
<p>Mephisto sighed, &quot;Because in the Middle Ages, although the Gate of the Abyss was also connected to the world, the world at that time was not as much as it is now, and it can even be said to be pitiful. At that time, once you go to other worlds, you will basically meet angels. As soon as the two parties meet, they will do a life and death. You can&#x27;t avoid them. Although the eternal war is like this, but the time is too long, the same will happen. Tired, not only the demon, but also the angels. Over time, both sides have formed some tacit understanding with each other. That is, the demon kings and the archangels will not easily go to these eternal battlefields, just let them The demons and angels fight by themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then... why was the tacit understanding broken?&quot; Roy asked.</p>
<p>The reason for asking this is that Roy also knows that in the bottom world of the abyss, it is difficult to see the demon kings. Naturally, the demon kings have gone to other worlds.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s because of the explosion of species!&quot; Mephisto said a word that surprised Roy. In his surprised eyes, Mephisto explained with a smile &quot;To be precise, it&#x27;s since humans After the birth, this tacit understanding was broken.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot; Roy rubbed his chin, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Mephisto smiled and said &quot;Just as you imagined, the human soul has a huge attraction to both demons and angels, so when the intelligent species of humans was born, the tacit understanding was broken! But... This is just one of them!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There are other reasons?&quot; Roy looked at him.</p>
<p>The look on Mephisto’s face became a little strange. He stretched his hand through his meticulously combed hair, and said, &quot;There is another reason, that is, we have discovered that since the birth of mankind, whether it is the gate of the abyss or The gates of heaven, the number of worlds that can be connected has suddenly increased, as if... as if these worlds were born with the birth of mankind, especially with the continuous development of human intelligence, some more wisdom Races have also begun to appear gradually, and the number of worlds has also increased day by day, especially in the past one or two thousand years, this growth rate has reached the highest peak, even the ancients of us, it is not clear how many worlds exist now.&quot;</p>
<p>Mephisto paused, and then said something that surprised Roy. He said &quot;Under curiosity, we have also tried to study human groups, and then we discovered an amazing fact, that It is that with the growth of human imagination, additional parallel worlds will appear!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; Roy looked at Mephisto with a look of stunned expression. He didn&#x27;t expect Mephisto to come to such an amazing conclusion.</p>
<p>When he was going to other worlds before and found characters and worldviews that made him familiar, Roy once suspected that the so-called ten thousand worlds were basically a world in human imagination, but these worlds were more real. And it&#x27;s just concrete. He thought that maybe only he knew about this, but he didn&#x27;t expect that old monsters like Mephisto seemed to have discovered this a long time ago!</p>
<p>This really caught Roy by surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Very surprised, isn&#x27;t it? But looking at your expression, you seem to have discovered some truth, haven&#x27;t you?&quot; Mephisto looked at Roy with a smile and said, &quot;Then, when you discovered this, it was a What kind of thinking? Is there a similar thinking like, &quot;Are we all living in a certain book?&quot;</p>
<p>This time, Roy nodded directly, he did have such thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not just you, but we old guys have also had similar thoughts!&quot; Mephisto sighed and said &quot;This is a desperate conclusion, whether it is for angels or demons. Once It made us almost crazy, so we broke the tacit understanding and started desperately going to other worlds where we could go, trying to find the truth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The result?&quot; Roy asked nervously.</p>
<p>&quot;The result?&quot; Mephisto glanced at him, with a playful expression on his face, and said &quot;The result is... we are all wrong!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot; These words stopped Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth and appearance of the world is indeed related to the human imagination!&quot; Mephisto looked at Roy&#x27;s twisted expression amused, and explained &quot;But it is not as we guessed, we are living in a certain In a two-dimensional world, it should be said in fact that human imagination is indeed the origin of all realms, but once these worlds appear, they will in turn reflect human imagination!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, what does this mean? Why am I so confused? What does it mean to mirror human imagination in turn?&quot; Roy hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Mephisto leaned back behind the seat and put a finger up and said &quot;For example, if a human being, he has an imagination, imagined a bizarre story fragment, and this imagined story Fragments, he pondered over and over again, and even shared them with others to let more people know and be familiar with them. Then this kind of cluster consciousness may affect the will of the void, causing this story fragment to be born in the void. That said new world will bound to a real world and will start to evolve on its own with the source point. That is, the story fragment, as a benchmark, and this evolution will in turn produce disturbances and make known The mankind in the story fragment further perfected his imagination! But by this time, the human imagination has completely turned into fiction, and the world of real evolution is there, but it has nothing to do with the human imagination...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...There is this kind of saying!?&quot; Roy felt even more confused, as if he understood, and didn&#x27;t seem to understand at all.</p>
<p>Mephisto paused, let Roy slow down, and then continued &quot;Don&#x27;t underestimate this conclusion. In fact, in order to understand the truth, we old guys will create clones for this to reduce our strength. The price of entering into many worlds at the same time for investigation, which also leads to the clones with independent personality no longer willing to return, because the clones believe that they are also real individuals... Well, it’s a bit far away, I don’t know if you have Have observed the activities of human beings, or have you seen the widely circulated literary works born in the human world? You must know that the existence of many worlds can find their source in their literary works, but after our research, we found that, These worlds are not static, and human intervention may cause the evolution of these worlds to go in another direction instead of continuing to follow the development of the plot in the literary and artistic works!&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Roy suddenly understood. Indeed, he had noticed this before. For example, in the world of Van Helsing, it is said that Van Helsing died, and Gabriel’s soul fragments were also picked up by him. This is not at all. It is in line with the plot he knows, but the problem is that the world still exists, and it doesn’t perish or anything. The Heroic Invincible World is also the same. Because of his appearance, the plot that he knew has already changed beyond recognition, but Sareth’s original story The dark Messiah that should exist, is still living well in the abyssal world...</p>
<p>This should be what Mephisto said, the world is actually the reason for its real existence and self-evolution...</p>
<p>&quot;The world is real, and we are real!&quot; Mephisto saw what Roy was thinking, and said &quot;This is undoubtedly, although it feels a bit strange, but I think this should be a certain deep meaning of the Creator, but we I can’t understand. Lucifer, Michael and these early demons and angels worshipped the Creator very much, so I always wanted to find the Creator and ask to understand, but I don’t have this idea. I am a demon. I think I just need to be myself. The role will do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not wrong to think so!&quot; Roy nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, here comes the question, as a demon, what should my role look like?&quot; Mephisto narrowed his eyes, with a weird smile on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;...Destroy the world?&quot; Roy tilted his head and looked at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I am an eternally denying spirit! As long as it is generated, everything will of course be destroyed, so it is not as good as nothing. Humans and angels call this destruction, crime, or simply &quot;evil&quot;. But this is the nature of my essence.&quot; Mephisto opened his hands and said &quot;This is also the essence of the demon!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then you showed up here to invite me to accompany you to destroy the world?&quot; Roy asked with some amusement &quot;With all due respect, Mephisto, the great king of hatred, you shouldn&#x27;t borrow the hands of others for this kind of thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This...&quot; Mephisto showed a slight hesitation on his face, but finally he said &quot;Because I... have encountered a difficult problem, a huge problem... This problem is even a bit beyond my control... …&quot;</p>
