    </h1>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Roy has confirmed one thing, that is, in this dream, Trag&#x27;Oul has a natural advantage.</p>
<p>This is probably the reason why he pulled Roy into his dream. Under such dream conditions, Roy was still confused about how to attack Trag&#x27;Oul and caused damage to him. It can be said that the counterattack ability is very limited.</p>
<p>If the sole purpose is to retaliate and create favorable conditions for oneself by continuously allowing Trag&#x27;Oul to accumulate &quot;knowledge,&quot; it would only lead to increasing losses.</p>
<p>Hence, the first thing that crossed Roy&#x27;s mind was not to engage in a direct confrontation with Trag&#x27;Oul within this dream. Such an approach would be futile and serve no meaningful purpose.</p>
<p>Roy raised his hand and looked at his demon claws. Although it was very real, Roy knew very well that it was probably just a &#x27;spiritual body&#x27;. If intelligent creatures were familiar with their own bodies, even their souls state will unconsciously maintain the appearance of his body. Since Trag&#x27;Oul has pulled himself into him dream, it means that he has connected his soul or spirit in some way, and he has never heard of it. What kind of ability can pull the physical body into the dream together, Roy&#x27;s original body should still be in the silver tower.</p>
<p>In this way, the situation became clear. In order to get out of this dream, Roy had to find a way to disconnect this link.</p>
<p>In truth, this is not the first encounter for Roy with a similar form of mental assault. Even when he was weak, he faced phantoms that targeted the mind. However, the extent to which Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s influence can affect the soul is unparalleled. As a demon king, Roy possesses immense power within his spirit and soul, rendering him largely immune to conventional mental attacks. Yet, Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s ability still managed to take effect, suggesting that this connection operates on an unconventional level.</p>
<p>The reason why Roy assume this to be the link between spirit and soul is because Roy found that he could still open the system interface in his mind here and the system was originally attached to his soul.</p>
<p>However, the system is probably not very helpful at this time. Even if Roy creates something through the system, once it exceeds Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s understanding, it is estimated that it will not be materialized. After all, this is a dream, an illusory world.</p>
<p>While Roy was thinking, Trag&#x27;Oul did not stop attacking Roy. When he understood the knowledge of light speed and cosmic space, he stopped attacking Roy with the starlight spear, but instead controlled what next to him. The huge sun attacked Roy with a huge wave of fire.</p>
<p>Roy let these high-temperature flames burn himself, but he didn&#x27;t fight back. He just wrapped his wings around his body to shrink and defense, because he realized that Trag&#x27;Oul had no idea how high the temperature of the sun was. Concept, if it is a real sun, the high temperature of tens of millions of degrees can instantly burn Roy to fly ashes, but the fire wave set off by the sun at this moment is only a few thousand degrees, probably...</p>
<p>It seems that it is only the limit temperature of ordinary flame magic. It is amazing that it can reach the temperature of hellfire...</p>
<p>This should still involve a cognitive problem. Trag&#x27;Oul has not really been close to the sun. His understanding of the sun&#x27;s light and heat is biased. It is estimated that although he also knows that the sun has a high temperature, it is limited to the flame magic. In terms of temperature, the temperature of flame magic is used as a reference.</p>
<p>Having realized this, Roy understands that waking Trag&#x27;Oul up is not a viable option. He consciously avoids dwelling on such thoughts, aware that if Trag&#x27;Oul can establish a connection between their spirits and souls, it is possible for Trag&#x27;Oul to gain insight into his innermost musings. Any fleeting idea or notion passing through Roy&#x27;s mind could be deciphered as a fragment of &quot;knowledge&quot; by Trag&#x27;Oul, potentially leading to complications down the line.</p>
<p>Roy just defended without saying a word. His tolerance for flames is much better now. Such a temperature can&#x27;t cause him too much damage, so he just kept looking around while defending in this dream space.</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s mind is unusually calm now. He guessed that if it is a connection on the soul, then this connection must have a special node. This node is the frequency between Roy&#x27;s soul and Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s soul frequency. The real reason to hit the line.</p>
<p>But before that, Roy had never seen Trag&#x27;Oul at all, and only knew of him existence. It was impossible for two complete strangers to achieve resonance in the frequency of their souls under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Unless...unless there is something, or cognition, that both Royin and Trag&#x27;Oul know about, and then use this as a node, Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s soul can connect with Roy&#x27;s soul...</p>
<p>Thinking about it this way, the answer is actually ready to come out, it should be a place of sanctuary!</p>
<p>Bowing his head, Roy looked at the planet under his feet. This planet was under his feet from the moment Roy was pulled into the dream, but it was not until he thought of the answer at this time that Roy thought of paying attention to it.</p>
<p>But then, Roy was a little puzzled, because he found out that the planet under his feet was not the world of Sanctuary!</p>
<p>During Roy&#x27;s stay on Xiansai Island, he had seen a lot of books by mortals. Among these books, many of them were maps recorded by explorers walking around the Sanctuary, which were finally put together to form a world of Sanctuary World. The map, however, the shape of the land on the planet, does not have the slightest resemblance to the world of Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Roy endured the burning pain. Taking advantage of the gap between the fire waves, his wings flew towards the planet under his feet. He wanted to verify it carefully. This flight made Roy realize that his guess was correct. , The real universe has no atmosphere, so the action of flapping wings is impossible to achieve, but in Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s dream, it still allows him to move and get close to the planet under his feet.</p>
<p>When seeing Roy approaching the planet, Trag&#x27;Oul didn&#x27;t show any anxiety, still attacked Roy unhurriedly, and continued to weaken Roy by creating pain.</p>
<p>Roy frowned and observed the planet again for a while and found that there is indeed a big difference. It does not seem to be the planet where the world of Sanctuary is located.</p>
<p>Recalling some relevant records in the history books, the artificial world of Sanctuary is a world similar to an eggshell. It was originally hidden by Inarius and Lilith with the power of the world stone, like a purgatory space mixed with it. It&#x27;s like a transparent egg in the depths... Thinking back on these records, Roy also thinks that he has made a mistake. The planet under his feet not only has a different land shape, but also doesn&#x27;t seem to be in a special state of being hidden.</p>
<p>Could it be that I thought wrong, that the real Sanctuary world in Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s dream was also hidden by it?</p>
<p>This is troublesome. With so many stars in the starry sky, which one is the real Sanctuary World?</p>
<p>Another round of powerful flames hit, Roy was rushed by the shock wave and rolled in the space. Roy frowned and glanced at the violent sun, fluttered his wings and flew away from the place,  then move towards the distant sun. Roy flew away to distance stars, intending to find the hidden world of the true Sanctuary.</p>
<p>However, after flying a short distance, Roy suddenly stopped! Trag&#x27;Oul, has never flown out of the planet where the Sanctuary is located, so how could he know what the shining stars in the starry sky are like?</p>
<p>Roy realized that this boundless starry sky is actually just the starry sky that Trag&#x27;Oul guy observed in the world of Sanctuary, but since he was unable to go to the starry sky, these starry sky in the dream were also the same. It&#x27;s really just the starry sky, or in other words, it&#x27;s just some background textures! Even if Roy could really fly to the positions of those stars, he wouldn&#x27;t be able to see any planets exist!</p>
<p>Ok, Roy almost fell for this guy trick! Roy grinned, he understood that planet under his feet was actually the real Sanctuary world. Only by being familiar with the Sanctuary world could Trag&#x27;Oul create such a real planet!</p>
<p>No wonder this guy shows his posture in the form of a constellation in the starry sky. The purpose is to confuse people and make Roy mistakenly think that this starry sky is a real star!</p>
<p>As for why the land shape of the planet under him feet deviates from the world map of Sanctuary, it is better to understand. As a guardian who has existed for an unknown number of years, he must have seen the movement and change of geological plates. Since he &#x27;knows&#x27; that the shape of the land can be changed, it is not difficult at all to make some changes to deceive Roy!</p>
<p>If Roy was really deceived by him and went to the depths of the starry sky to find the real world of sanctuary, he would not be able to find it even if he flew to death. Trag&#x27;Oul could completely destroy Roy&#x27;s soul through a long period of time. Kill it, completely wipe out Roy&#x27;s soul in this dream, and completely kill Roy!</p>
<p>And time, for a star soul titan, is the least valuable thing...</p>
<p>Roy, who understood it, think that Trag&#x27;Oul was very dangerous. he didn&#x27;t expect Trag&#x27;Oul to be very cunning. he might also know that he could guess the problem of the soul link node, so he deliberately made a black-out scam to let Roy appeared in the dream, he was near the real link node. If Roy was the kind of reckless devil who was simple-minded and only believed in power, this strategy might have really succeeded.</p>
<p>But Roy is not such a devil. In fact, it is easy to see through this scam, as long as you think about it based on Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s &quot;cognition&quot;.</p>
<p>Raising his head, Roy looked at the illusory figure in the shape of a dragon in the distance, and said with a savage smile: &quot;Trag&#x27;Oul, don&#x27;t let me catch you, once I catch you, I swear to take your star soul Titan. Take out the soul and feed it to my dragon!&quot;</p>
<p>After saying this, Roy fluttered his wings and plunged towards the planet under his feet!</p>
