        <span>526 - Roy&#x27;s true intentions</span>
    </h1>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>When the light reappeared in Roy eyes, the eye of the void on Roy&#x27;s chest slowly closed. This eye of the void is only an auxiliary organ and it can only function in a void environment. The void symbol in the wings behind him The lines of text have also lost their radiance, all of which signify that Roy has returned to the material world.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, the material world is better!&quot; Roy sighed, then looked down, stretched out his hand and used his sharp index finger and thumb nail to twist up a nearby upper rank demon. The upper rank demon was about two meters high, but In front of Roy&#x27;s misty body, he looked so short. He was grabbed by the back of his neck and hung in the air by Roy. He didn&#x27;t dare to move at all.</p>
<p>&quot;How long have I been away?&quot; Roy asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;Your Majesty Osiris, your aura just disappeared from the battlefield for about four hours...&quot; the upper demon replied respectfully.</p>
<p>Roy nodded, four hours, it&#x27;s been a little long, so he left the upper demon, and then observed the situation on the battlefield. Roy found that the demons did a good job, at least the enchantment of the silver city was beaten Broken.</p>
<p>It can also be seen from this point that the demons are still very efficient in executing orders. Roy did not have any instructions when he was exiled. The demons have always followed the initial attack order. They haven&#x27;t slack off for a while.</p>
<p>Roy felt that it had been a little long since the four disappeared, but for Tyrael, his eyes were full of horror. He never thought that Roy would come back so quickly!</p>
<p>Void! That is emptiness! The two archangels banished him together, only to keep him trapped in the void for four hours!?</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, when did such a monster-like demon appear in the abyss world!?&quot; Tyrael was dripping with cold sweat on his forehead. He glanced around, but he couldn&#x27;t see Auriel coming back with him. He knew that it was troublesome, and that Auriel might have an accident.</p>
<p>&quot;Go and inform Imperius immediately!&quot; Tyrael grabbed an angel warrior beside him and said anxiously &quot;Tell him the news of Osiris&#x27;s return from the void and let him come and help!&quot;</p>
<p>The angel warrior nodded, turned quickly and flew to the silver city, while Tyrael looked at the hundreds of angel warriors around him and said loudly &quot;All angel warriors, join me to face the demon king Osiris! He attacked the Diamond Gate!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As your command!&quot;</p>
<p>So, with Tyrael as the arrow, hundreds of angels flapped the wings of light together, rushed down from the sky, and rushed towards Roy&#x27;s position.</p>
<p>Seeing hundreds of streamers from the sky flying towards him, Roy sneered, raised his palm and aimed at the charging angel army. In the next second, countless purple lightning bursts appeared in his palm. These purple lightnings turned into a large net that enveloped the Angel Legion.</p>
<p>When Tyrael saw Roy&#x27;s attack, he knew that the purple lightning was weird, so he shouted &quot;Be careful&quot; and took the lead in pulling up, trying to avoid Roy&#x27;s attack.</p>
<p>However, apart from a group of angel warriors who responded quickly in front, the angels who were charging at a high speed behind them were too late. Although they tried their best to fly upwards, the extremely fast lightning had already rushed to them, and they saw that they were about to be hit by lightning. they can only try their best to strengthen their shields of light and want to resist the attack of lightning power.</p>
<p>But then a strange thing happened. All the angel warriors who were hit by the purple lightning did not receive any elemental damage. The moment they were hit, they were wrapped in a purple halo. A soft sound came, and the bodies of the angel warriors disappeared, replaced by all kinds of...food that fell from the sky!?</p>
<p>There are cheeses, biscuits, chocolates, and even Coke, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Tyrael was stunned when he saw this scene, dumbfounded and didn&#x27;t know what happened, as were the rest of the angels who were lucky enough to escape.</p>
<p>The food scattered from the sky finally landed on the battlefield. The demons on the ground who had raised their heads and screamed got hit on the head by the food. They lowered their heads in confusion and sniffed the food. After smelling the tempting aroma from above, he tentatively swallowed the food into his stomach.</p>
<p>In the next second, the eyes of these demons who were lucky enough to pick up the food lit up!</p>
<p>So delicious! Not only can you taste the flavor of the angel&#x27;s soul from the food, but also has a fascinating taste that has never been seen before eating raw meat and blood!</p>
<p>The taste of angel souls is actually not good for demons, but now that angels are made sweets, they are immediately different. There are many demons who have never tasted sweets, so after tasting sweets for the first time, Immediately fell in love with this special taste, in their minds, immediately added a formula <code v-pre>angel = sweets</code>!</p>
<p>There was still some food on the ground that had not been swallowed. The demons on the battlefield who had tasted the taste immediately began to fight. Their actions attracted other demons who had not eaten to follow along, even caused a small disturbance.</p>
<p>Soon, the sweets that these angels turned into were all divided up. When they finally found out that they were gone, the demons turned around and looked at Roy eagerly, hoping that Lord Osiris would give some more rewards.</p>
<p>Yes, reward, this is a small reward given by Roy to the demons who have been fighting for a long time. He has not used the ability to deform light for a long time. Now it is released in combination with the power of lightning, and the effect is extraordinary. Those strengths were originally far low. Roy&#x27;s angel warrior, after being transformed into food by the deformed light, was eaten by demons before he could change back.</p>
<p>Tyrael&#x27;s eyes were tearing apart. Hundreds of angel warriors were gone!? Even the soul has no time to return to the crystal arch!?</p>
<p>Tyrael, who was dazzled by anger, rushed towards Roy, holding the brilliance of the holy feather and slashed at Roy with his head covered. The coverage area of ​​the light wings behind him had expanded several times by now, it is clear that all the power has been used.</p>
<p>Roy, in turn, shrunk the misty body to a height of more than three meters, then took out Frostmourne and slashed Tyrael. The battle between the two detonated a large energy shock wave, surrounding The demons and angels all screamed and avoided.</p>
<p>&quot;Why!? Why can you come back from the void!?&quot; Tyrael asked angrily loudly while fighting Roy &quot;What kind of demon are you!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why are you so angry?&quot; Roy grinned and slammed his sword on his sword, smashing him several meters away.Then Roy rushed up, Frostmourne slashed at Tyrael&#x27;s light wings, saying &quot;You guys It should be understood that since I dare to enter the High Heaven alone, it is natural for me to rely on me! Don&#x27;t you still think that I am bluffing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damnit! In the name of justice, I must defeat you!&quot; Tyrael avoided Roy&#x27;s slash, waved his light wings and launched countless holy light bullets at Roy, but Roy&#x27;s body suddenly disintegrated and turned into countless fist-sized individuals. All of these individuals were exactly the same as Roy&#x27;s. With the help of the clone of the Heart of the Swarm, none of the holy light bullets that Tyrael shot densely hit, all of which were dodge by Roy.</p>
<p>Thousands of fist-sized individuals swooped up behind Tyrael and lay on Tyrael&#x27;s light wings. The magic of the darkest cold broke out, instantly freezing Tyrael&#x27;s light wings into black ice crystals.</p>
<p>Tyrael&#x27;s Light Wing was frozen. Although he did not fall, his maneuverability was greatly affected. Taking this opportunity, hundreds of thousands of Roy&#x27;s avatars formed five or six groups, gathered together, and merged into five or six clone. The clones were about one meter tall. The right hands of these clones were all wearing the Red Dragon Emperor Gauntlet. They threw their fists and beat Tyrael&#x27;s body violently.</p>
<p>Tyrael was beaten and trembled. Although the damage was not great, it was extremely humiliating. When he roared and swung his sword to cut off these clones, the clones turned into smaller individuals again, calmly. dodged the slash.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it possible? How is it possible!?&quot;</p>
<p>These strange abilities of Roy made Tyrael complain a lot. At this time, he had actually used his authority and power. Although he took over the position of the angel of wisdom - Malthael, what he used was what originally belonged to him. The power of justice and authority, under the power of authority, Tyrael&#x27;s holy feather&#x27;s brilliance can cut through all evil things, but he can&#x27;t cut Roy&#x27;s Frostmourne cursed word.</p>
<p>This made him a little unbelievable, and he couldn&#x27;t help roaring &quot;How can the brilliance of light unable to cut off your evil!?&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing his words, Roy paused the attack, took back all the clones of the swarm, and re-condensed his body. Roy looked at Tyrael who was panting across from him and said with a smile &quot;Why is it not possible Tyrael? Mephisto told me something about your power and authority, your holy sword seems to be able to cut through all evil, but I want to ask you, after I came to this world, have I done anything evil?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You...&quot; Tyrael got stuck at the moment, yes, think about it carefully, after the Demon King Osiris came to the world of Sanctuary, it seems that he did not kill any mortals, at least he did not kill or harvest over the soul of any mortal, since he came, he has been more hidden behind the scenes.</p>
<p>This is indeed the case. Since Roy&#x27;s arrival, he has never dealt with the Nephalem people in the Sanctuary. On the island of Xiansai where he lives, people on the island don&#x27;t even know of his existence. There was a lot of demon gold flowing out of it, but the demon gold just magnified the evil thoughts in the hearts of mortals, and it had nothing to do with Roy himself, and the cause and effect could not actually implicate him.</p>
<p>After he came to this world, there were only two things he really did. One was to imprison Tyrael&#x27;s soul and the other was to lead the demon army into the High Heaven.</p>
<p>This is where Tyrael is puzzled. It is said that breaking into the High Heaven is already considered evil... What went wrong in the end!?</p>
<p>Roy perceived Tyrael&#x27;s lingering uncertainty and grinned mischievously. &quot;Tyrael, do you not find it contradictory that attacking your own angels is considered evil? Well, it seems your sword doesn&#x27;t share that sentiment! In this world, the notion of justice upheld by your higher realms of heaven appears to be quite questionable!&quot;</p>
<p>There was a thunder in Tyrael&#x27;s mind and Roy&#x27;s words completely woke Tyrael. He looked at the brilliance of the holy feather in his hand with a bitter look, and said, &quot;Is that so? We don&#x27;t actually represent justice?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Archangel Tyrael, I don&#x27;t know how long you have been trapped in this world...&quot; Roy raised his head and said, &quot;Unlike you, I have been to many different worlds, and I have witnessed many angels Fallen, since even angels can fall, why do you dare to say that angels are righteous Tyrael? There seems to be a problem with your cognition of your authority and power!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; Tyrael floated motionless in the air, thinking about Roy&#x27;s words, but after a while, the dejected light in Tyrael&#x27;s eyes disappeared, he raised his head and looked at Roy and said, &quot;No! It&#x27;s not me. There is a problem with the cognition of authority and power, but you! Demon King Osiris, you have no malice towards this world, right!?”</p>
<p>Roy looked at him in surprise and said, &quot;Huh? You actually reacted?&quot;</p>
<p>After speaking, Roy also nodded and admitted generously &quot;Yes, it is different from what you imagined. From the beginning, I never thought about destroying the world of Sanctuary!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then what do you want to do?&quot; Tyrael asked suspiciously &quot;Didn&#x27;t you come because of Mephisto? What else can the Seven Devils want to do other than destroy the world of Sanctuary?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mephisto didn&#x27;t tell me the truth, they actually got out of trouble. The reason they really came to me may be to deal with another person...&quot; Roy shook his head. He was talking about Lilith, but he didn&#x27;t say that. It was necessary to tell Tyrael too clearly, he said &quot;As for myself, I actually really want to keep the world of Sanctuary. I plan to get a... playground for my children!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Playground? Your child?&quot; Tyrael frowned. &quot;A... demon prince?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, my child is also a Nephalem!&quot; Roy&#x27;s words were astonishing, making Tyrael even dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&quot;This... how is this possible? You are lying to me!?&quot; Tyrael couldn&#x27;t believe it and roared &quot;Is it fun to fool me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What am I lying to you for? Is there any benefit?&quot; Roy glanced at him angrily and said, &quot;That is my adopted son Sareth, in another world, he is called the dark messiah. In that world, whether it is an angel, a human, or a demon, everyone wants to kill him. I brought him back to the abyss world and raised him... Sareth is a good boy, but the abyss world is not very suitable for him, where he will only be a demon in the end, and he should have more options... He is still young, but he will always grow up, the world of Sanctuary is full of nephalems, so it counts It&#x27;s his countryman, maybe he can live unfettered in this world...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...Understandable!&quot; Tyrael took a deep breath and said &quot;Whether you are deceiving me or not, I also understand the reason why you attacked the High Heaven you want to expel all the angels Without the angels, the eternal battle will be over, and the seven demon kings and demons can also return to the abyss world, and you, with your great record of conquering the High Heaven, can protect the world of Sanctuary from the hands of the seven demon kings?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Basically!&quot; Roy nodded and said, &quot;If Mephisto and the other old men disagree, maybe I might have a fight with them...&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrael looked at Roy strangely &quot;To be honest, I doubt whether you are a real demon now!&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Roy pondered for a while, and finally said</p>
<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s see, when I think so... that&#x27;s it!&quot;</p>
