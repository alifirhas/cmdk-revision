<p>Hearing Roy&#x27;s shout, Imperius and Itherael were suddenly shocked, and immediately spread their perceptions, wanting to see if it was Mephisto and the others who had arrived.</p>
<p>However, in their perception, they did not find any trace of Mephisto.</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t speak either, but just waited quietly. The scene was silent for a while, which made Imperius and Itherael look at Roy with strange eyes, but almost didn&#x27;t say the phrase &#x27;to make a mystery&#x27;.</p>
<p>Until the end, Roy sighed and said again &quot;Come out, don&#x27;t hide!&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he lowered his head and looked at the circle of demons surrounding him. Then he waved his hand and the three high-ranking demons were twisted out by his psychic force. The three high-ranking demons were terrified. The ground floated in mid-air, struggling constantly, and said, &quot;Your Majesty Osiris, you... you are mistaken?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t be wrong!&quot; Roy looked at the three high-ranking demons, shook his head and said, &quot;But I don&#x27;t blame you, because of yourself don&#x27;t know when you were &#x27;seed&#x27;!&quot;</p>
<p>The three high-ranking demons were startled, but before they could make a sound, a powerful dark force suddenly erupted in the depths of their hearts.</p>
<p>Their demon&#x27;s heart was torn apart and the dark power poured out to hold the three upper-level demons to pieces, and then the dark power began to reshape their bodies. Countless granulation grew from their bodies, wrapping them into wriggling cocoons. The ominous aura also began to spread.</p>
<p>Yes, the demon kings planted the seeds of parasitic souls on these three high-ranking demons. When the power of the seeds exploded, they were swallowed up with all their flesh and blood without even being able to resist. After opening, three new demons filled with powerful dark power appeared in front of everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s really you...&quot; Imperius and Itherael couldn&#x27;t help gasping for air as they watched this scene.</p>
<p>Of these three new giant demons, one of which was seen by Roy in the Frozen Throne, Mephisto&#x27;s clone is the same, and among the other two, one is a human-shaped upright demon, and the epidermis of his body is It is a hard bone armor, with a blood red background in the black, a pair of giant pincer-shaped demon horns on the head, and a pair of demon horns also wrapped around the cheeks, and behind him, there are several There were many sharp bone spurs, and the bone spurs went down along the vertebrae and spread all the way to the iron whip-like tail, which looked very hideous.</p>
<p>This one, needless to say, is the clone of Diablo, the Lord of Fear!</p>
<p>The last remaining one is a worm-shaped demon. His lower body is supported by four huge worm feet. The sharp worm feet pierce the ground and easily sink into a depth of half a meter. It has a ferocious and bloodthirsty demon face. On its head, three tentacle-like demon horns are lined up side by side, and they dance in the wind. This is the first time Roy has seen this kind of devil&#x27;s horn that is not hard. That said, it&#x27;s quite distinctive, and it&#x27;s an iconic appearance.</p>
<p>This one is the King of Destruction - Baal!</p>
<p>In just a moment, Mephisto - the king of hatred, Diablo - the king of fear, and Baal - the king of destruction appear in high-heave. The three giants headed by the Seven Demon Kings of Hell have appeared in the High Heaven.</p>
<p>&quot;what-!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he appeared, Mephisto let out a satisfied sigh, then looked at Roy and said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t expect that I would stand on the ground of High Heaven again. This feeling is really wonderful, what do you think?&quot; Osiris?&quot;</p>
<p>Roy stared at him, but did not speak, but Imperius, who was opposite, said angrily &quot;This is impossible, Mephisto! How can you both regain your strength so quickly!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah don&#x27;t be like that!&quot; The King of Destruction Baal laughed wildly and spread his hands &quot;Yes, Imperius, under normal circumstances, it is impossible for us to recover our strength so quickly, but you will never guess it. The fragments scattered in all directions after the World Stone exploded, how much energy has been supplied to us in the hell of flames... We ordered people to collect them secretly, even if the amount obtained is not much, it is enough for us to act on our own.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shards of the World Stone...&quot; Imperius finally understood the reason why the power of the Seven Demon Kings was recovering faster than the High Heaven had estimated, and he was instantly annoyed.</p>
<p>&quot;Imperius, my old rival, we meet again!&quot; Diablo took a few steps forward, looked at Imperius from a distance and said with a grinning smile, &quot;You remember being beaten badly by me last time. Do you miss me? Now I&#x27;m back, but you still look like this bereaved dog.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; Imperius raised his spear of courage and pointed at Diablo and shouted angrily, &quot;The High Heaven was able to thwart your conspiracy last time, and it will do the same this time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t be shy!&quot; Diablo also roared at Imperius and the scorching flames spewed from his throat.</p>
<p>The two sides seemed to disagree and were ready to fight. At this moment, Roy finally spoke up and said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t I go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uh...&quot; The Big Three then remembered that the leader of this war was still on the scene, Mephisto&#x27;s ugly face showed a grin, and said to Roy &quot;Sorry, Osiris, my brother, we were so excited to meet our old rivals...I think, this is the first time you&#x27;ve met Diablo and Ball?&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing Mephisto&#x27;s words, Diablo and Ball both turned their heads and looked at Roy. At this moment, Roy was not in the form of a misty body, but a normal body height of more than three meters, which caused Diablo and Ball to look down at Roy. They are taller than him, when they looked at Roy, they couldn&#x27;t help but feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>However, the powerful power pervading Roy cannot be faked, so Diablo and Ball did not dare to despise Roy, Diablo nodded to Roy and said, &quot;Osiris, you did a great job, Starting from today, all the worlds here will sing your reputation of conquering the High Heaven, I think you can consider adding the title of &#x27;World Destroyer&#x27; to yourself...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right!&quot; Baal nodded with a smirk, &quot;From now on, the Hell of Flames will be the Four Demon Gods!&quot;</p>
<p>Whether it is Diablo, Baal or Mephisto, these three giants are all old demons who have lived for an unknown period of time. Their words and praise are full of the gratified expressions of the old seniors looking at the new juniors, but in reality Roy didn&#x27;t know what his Senior was thinking... Roy knew this very well, so he didn&#x27;t take their words to heart at all, but instead spoke up slightly sarcastically &quot;I said you three old guys, I found three secretly. I&#x27;m a substitute, but I don&#x27;t take the initiative to show up, if I hadn&#x27;t found you, you would have wanted to just watch me fight until the last moment, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing Roy&#x27;s words, Mephisto and the others were actually a little embarrassed. To be honest, not only Roy was guarding them, but they were also secretly guarding against Roy, although Roy was found by Mephisto. Foreign aid, but how long has Roy been in this world? They are not sure what Roy&#x27;s character is at all. In this case, how can they trust Roy?</p>
<p>The relationship between the Demon Kings has never been peaceful. Although the Seven Demon Kings have recovered more than expected, most of the time, they can only act as clones, and such clones are not only lacking in strength, but also because they need to be separated. Because of the part of the soul, there is a natural disadvantage. Once Roy has bad intentions towards them and attacks their clones, this part of the soul may be wiped out...</p>
<p>Therefore, the three giants actually do not want to appear if they can appear. Their soul seeds are parasitic in the bodies of the three upper-level demons, and the battle information can be observed through the three upper-level demons, and with the help of the original breath of the three upper-level demons Covered, they even concealed Imperius, but what they didn&#x27;t expect was that they were caught by Roy.</p>
<p>Until this time, they don&#x27;t want to appear anymore...</p>
<p>I wanted to ask how Roy found them, but it was not easy to ask, because as soon as these words came out, I felt that the momentum was weaker than Roy, so the three old demons tacitly did not mention this at all. A crop.</p>
<p>As for how Roy discovered them, it is actually very simple. It is not based on any special perception, but Roy firmly believes that at the last moment of capturing the High Heaven, as the one who fought the eternal battle with the High Heaven for so long It is impossible for the Seven Devils of Hell to miss this moment.</p>
<p>In fact, he just shouted that out with the attitude of giving it a try, and after shouting, he was keenly aware that among the demons, there were three demons who shouted at him differently from other demons. behavioral attitude...</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, Roy actually deceived the Big Three. This truth may soon be realized by Mephisto and the others, but currently, as a result of this incident, Roy&#x27;s momentum has been significantly suppressed, affecting all three of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Since everyone is here, then it&#x27;s time to do something!&quot; Roy said to the three old guys &quot;You fought with the High Heaven for so long, I believe that you don&#x27;t want to do nothing now, the High Heaven just gone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course!&quot; Mephisto nodded, turned to look at Imperius and Itherael &quot;Although the power of the clone is not enough, the three of us should  be able to drag the two archangels. The problem, the crystal arch will be handed over to you!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy was noncommittal, but then he spread his wings and floated up. His action was the signal for the general attack. The remaining demon army roared and rushed towards the opposite angel army first. strangled together.</p>
<p>As for Mephisto Diablo and Baal, they smirked and went straight to Imperius and Itherael!</p>
<p>An unobstructed path emerged, and Roy soared straight into the corridor leading to the main hall of the Crystal Arch. Imperius and Itherael attempted to stop him, but their efforts were in vain, leaving them only able to roar in frustration as they helplessly watched Roy. Gradually, Roy&#x27;s figure vanished at the end of the promenade...</p>
