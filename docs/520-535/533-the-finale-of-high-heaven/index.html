    </h1>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>In fact, the moment Roy stop again, the phantom of Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s Dragon Constellation suddenly flickered.</p>
<p>After hearing Roy&#x27;s cruel words and his actions, Trag&#x27;Oul knew it was over!</p>
<p>Before, he controlled the flames of the sun and attacked Roy unhurriedly. To put it bluntly, he had a guilty conscience. In order not to let Roy see this guilty conscience, he had to act like he didn&#x27;t care.</p>
<p>he almost succeeded and briefly confused Roy, making Roy almost fooled. If he hadn&#x27;t reacted in time, Roy would really have rushed into the depths of the starry sky.</p>
<p>But now, in this intellectual struggle, Roy has won. Roy, who has traveled through several worlds, is not comparable to Trag&#x27;Oul, a stay at home dragon, even if he is a star soul titan.</p>
<p>His so-called ways of balance can only fool those necromancers who believe in his. Without these, his essence is just an immature star-soul titan who has to hide for self-protection.</p>
<p>It was only at this moment, after Roy had seen through him, that he realized none of these demon kings were to be taken lightly. Trag&#x27;Oul, with his own capability to vanquish demons, intentionally kept his distance from him, rendering him powerless to halt Roy&#x27;s advances.</p>
<p>When Roy rushed into the planet under his feet, Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s entire dream began to shake.</p>
<p>Roy originally thought that if he wanted to destroy this link node, he had to find a way to destroy the planet, but what he didn&#x27;t expect was that the planet was actually too fragile, just as Roy had guessed, this planet is where his soul docked with Trag&#x27;Oul. When Roy wanted to destroy it, he could easily destroy it without even needing any special power.</p>
<p>Because this place is just a dream of Trag&#x27;Oul, this planet is naturally impossible to be a real planet. Although Roy has land on it, the land was trampled by Roy the moment he slammed into the ground. !</p>
<p>The cracked earth spreads in all directions at a fast speed. If you look down from space at this time, you will find that the entire planet is centered on Roy&#x27;s landing point, and it has become torn apart.</p>
<p>Not only was the planet being torn apart, but the entire dream space was shaking violently. Roy looked up and could see that the sun was shaking in the sky. Roy&#x27;s own body also began to become illusory. Dream space was destroyed, resulting in link instability.</p>
<p>The world was collapsing, the dream was cracking, and Trag&#x27;Oul knew that the disconnection of the link was inevitable, so he didn&#x27;t do any useless struggles. When the whole picture in front of Roy&#x27;s eyes collapsed, he heard Trag&#x27;Oul left a sigh, and he didn&#x27;t know whether he was pity for his powerlessness, or for letting Roy go, maybe both.</p>
<p>When Roy opened his eyes again, he found that he had returned to the silver tower. How long has it been.</p>
<p>As for Trag&#x27;Oul echoing in the silver tower before, the whispering voice of the soul had already disappeared at this time. After this time Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s plan to trap Roy through a dream failed, he probably did not dare to appeared in front of Roy again.</p>
<p>However, Roy didn&#x27;t intend to let his go, and squeezed his demon&#x27;s claw forcefully, a sinister smile appeared on Roy&#x27;s face.</p>
<p>It would be fine if Trag&#x27;Oul had been hiding and not showing up. Roy actually didn&#x27;t have much interest in his, an immature star-soul titan, but this guy not only appeared, but also boldly treated himself. That&#x27;s another story.</p>
<p>Everyone should be responsible for what they did, even if he was a star soul titan. Since he attacked Roy, he should wait for Roy&#x27;s revenge.</p>
<p>Hmm... Actually thinking about it, it&#x27;s not bad to be able to capture a Star Soul Titan, especially since Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s soul form is still the form of a long dragon, so Roy think Rafaro will be happy to devour Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s soul, which will allow Rafaro&#x27;s power to grow tremendously, and the &quot;Sky Dragon of Osiris&quot; will become even more powerful.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the next step. Trag&#x27;Oul is now estimated to be hiding again. In order to find him, Roy has to go back to the world of Sanctuary, and then he will have to snatch Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s soul. Roy put some protection, otherwise it will be troublesome to be pulled into a dream again...</p>
<p>The most urgent task at the moment is to destroy the High Heaven and Roy don&#x27;t know how long it have been delayed. What happened to Mephisto and Imperius under the silver tower.</p>
<p>Taking steps again, Roy continued to move up. It took a while for him to finally arrive at the location of Anu&#x27;s Crest Crystal, the so-called Crystal Dome Hall.</p>
<p>Given the importance of Anu&#x27;s Crest, it is naturally impossible for the crystal dome to have no protection at all. This hall has a gate that is closed by a powerful divine force, and there are the only remaining four elite high-level angels guarding them. They have been guarding outside the gate, even if the entire high-level heaven is in a turbulent fight, they have not gone out to participate in the war.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that in the previous attack, Diablo managed to breach the crystal dome using an unknown method, catching them off guard. Imperius and the others were unaware of his presence until Diablo had already begun tampering with Anu&#x27;s Crest Crystal, at which point they realized the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>However, it was already too late at that point. The souls of the angels in all of High Heaven were bound to Anu&#x27;s Crest, which allowed for their continuous regeneration. However, this arrangement came with its own shortcomings. When Diablo&#x27;s power contaminated Anu&#x27;s Crest, it had a profound impact on the angels of High Heaven, implicating them all.</p>
<p>Under the contamination of Diablo&#x27;s dark power, the angel&#x27;s wings lost their light, and the power of the Holy Light no longer took care of them. At that time, the angels in the entire High Heaven were abolished!</p>
<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for Tyrael, the archangel who cut off his light wings and condensed a mortal body at that time, he will be polluted by Diablo&#x27;s power. Tyrael then brought a group of Nephalem warriors into the high-level heaven to help, afraid that the high-level heaven no longer exists.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Imperius became aware of the immense hidden danger posed to the angels. Therefore, during the reconstruction of High Heaven, he took measures to not only isolate the power connection between Anu&#x27;s Crest Crystal and the angels but also employed his own formidable divine power. He sealed the Crystal Dome Hall and made it accessible only when necessary. However, due to lingering concerns, a special guardian angel was appointed as an added precaution.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just that Imperius never thought that these settings he made would take effect after a short interval of ten years...</p>
<p>When they saw Roy appearing, the four elite high-level angels recognized Roy immediately. Of course, they knew that the high-level heaven was attacked by the Demon King Osiris this time, but they had been guarding here and lacked contact with the outside world. So they didn&#x27;t know what the situation was. After seeing Roy&#x27;s appearance, they immediately realized sadly that the high-level paradise had been captured again.</p>
<p>But it was their duty to guard the crystal dome, so they didn&#x27;t think much about it, and immediately rushed up with their weapons in roar, launching a desperate blow to Roy.</p>
<p>Although they were high-level angels, their attacks did not pose any threat to Roy. After a few minutes of delay, Roy destroyed the four guardian angels.</p>
<p>Seeing their souls drift in through the gate of the crystal dome, Roy did not stop him. Anyway, he would be able to see Anu&#x27;s Crest soon, and by then he would be able to see almost all the angel souls who died in battle.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, Roy lifted his right hand, unleashing a surge of potent chaotic energy from his palm. The energy transformed into a misty beam of light, aimed at the door sealed by divine power. It carried the same force as Imperius&#x27;s full strike, essentially putting Roy in a direct confrontation against him.</p>
<p>However, since Roy was not using a dark power, there was no conflict with the divine power. After the collision of the two powers, it did not cause a huge explosion.</p>
<p>Under the continuous output of Roy&#x27;s power, the power poured into the gate was finally exhausted, and the two gates finally slowly fell down, making a loud noise like a whimper.</p>
<p>The sound even spread throughout the entire silver tower. The angels and the demons who were still at war below heard the whine. The demons headed by Mephisto and the three giants showed ecstatic expressions on their faces, while The angels leaded by Imperius were full of anxiety.</p>
<p>&quot;No! Anu&#x27;s Crest, this never happen!</p>
<p>Imperius&#x27;s inner anger could no longer be vented. He forced Mephisto back with one move, leaving his opponent and rushing towards the silver tower, wanting to rush and stop Roy.</p>
<p>At this time, Mephisto should have rushed up to tightly entangle Imperius, but when he looked at Diablo and Baal, the three demon kings tacitly ignored Imperius who left, but rushed towards Itherael together.</p>
<p>Itherael was already hard to support Imperius, but this time, under the siege of the three demon kings, there were frequent flaws. Soon, Mephisto found an opportunity and shredded Itherael left wing directly, while Baal shredded The light wing on his right, and Diablo grabbed Itherael Scroll of Fate!</p>
<p>&quot;Today, is your destruction!&quot;</p>
<p>Diablo roared proudly and with the force of the demon&#x27;s claws, the Scroll of Fate was torn to shreds!</p>
<p>Watching the scroll of fate turned into countless light spots and gradually scattered, Itherael, who was pierced by Mephisto and Baal&#x27;s claws, did not feel pain, but instead felt sorrow.</p>
<p>It remind Itherael of the prophecy I saw on the scroll before...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the end comes, wisdom will be lost, <br>
And justice will fall to earth, <br>
Bravery burns into rage— <br>
And all hope will be swallowed up by despair. <br>
At last, death will spread its wings and cover the sun— <br>
Fate was torn to shreds forever. <br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s all fulfilled...&quot; Itherael stretched out his hand, looking towards the sky to grab something, and muttered to himself, &quot;So that&#x27;s the case, so the end is coming...&quot;</p>
<p>Before he could finish his words, his entire body had turned into a light spot and dissipated, and his overflowing soul circled and flew towards the crystal dome.</p>
<p>Mephisto and the others watched this scene, but they didn&#x27;t capture the soul of Itherael. The three old guys looked at each other, nodded, turned around and walked back, three scarlet portals suddenly appeared Appeared, teleported them back to the Hell of Flames.</p>
<p>They just left Roy and returned to the Hell of Flames. As for whether they trusted Roy, they thought it was no problem for Roy to win the high-level heaven, or if they had other plans, only the three of them would know...</p>
