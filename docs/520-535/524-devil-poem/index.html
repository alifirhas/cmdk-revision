<p>When she fell into the void, although Auriel broke free from Roy&#x27;s Frostmourne, she didn&#x27;t get far from Roy&#x27;s vicinity, just because in the void, Roy and she both looked at each other. Smearing, without any perception, neither of them knew that the other was actually nearby.</p>
<p>Roy thought that Auriel was separated by the void, and Auriel also thought that she had gotten rid of the terrifying demon king.</p>
<p>It was not until Roy completed his self-evolution and could see in the void with the help of the newly born Eye of the Void, that he discovered where Auriel was.</p>
<p>Compared with Roy, the guy who is open, Auriel is not so lucky. Her current situation is very bad.</p>
<p>Originally, in the eyes of an archangel of hope like Auriel, the world is colorful, splendid, beautiful, full of light of harmony and hope. Auriel has long been accustomed to this perception, but when she After falling into the void, all hope and goodness disappeared.</p>
<p>She couldn&#x27;t see any light, couldn&#x27;t hear any sound, couldn&#x27;t feel the wind blowing, and this huge sense of contrast appeared suddenly, so that Auriel panicked like never before.</p>
<p>Angels also have emotions. Although most of the time their emotions are positive and bright, this does not mean that they will not have negative emotions. They will also panic, fear, anger, and anxiety.</p>
<p>Facing the strange environment of the void, she subconsciously activated the shield of light to cover her entire body to prevent unknown damage.</p>
<p>But then she discovered that the shield of holy light did not glow, or that she could not see the light of the shield, but could only feel the power of the holy light on the shield, which was escaping and dissipating rapidly.</p>
<p>Certainly, Auriel has heard of the void, but she has never truly encountered it. In her understanding, the void represents an eternal abyss of darkness, fraught with constant perils. Such perception instills a sense of caution within her, preventing any hint of complacency. Hence, even as she notices the power dissipating, she resolutely endeavors to uphold the protective shield, exerting her utmost effort.</p>
<p>It is said that in the void, the speed of pure magic dissipating is slow, then the elemental spells converted from magic will dissipate more than ten times faster. When she finds out that her holy light cannot be replenished in this void at all, she finally try calmed down, but it was already a little late. At least half of her magic power was converted into holy light and dissipated.</p>
<p>When she calmed down and canceled the shield of holy light, she found that the void was still eroding her. As the archangel, her body had already been completely transformed into holy light, but in the void, the holy light in her body The light keeps dissipating all the time.</p>
<p>Then, she found an even bigger trouble. Her abdomen was stabbed by the magic sword of Osiris, but it did not heal. A very powerful curse force prevented the elementalization process of her body and the position of her abdomen was transparent. The gap remains there.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; Auriel swiftly grasped the gravity of the situation. Under normal circumstances, regardless of the curse&#x27;s intensity, she could rely on the Holy Light to counteract its effects. However, in this void environment, her access to the Holy Light was nonexistent, leaving her power severely restricted.</p>
<p>So, now Auriel is faced with a choice, should she concentrate on eliminating this cursed power first, or should she just let it go?</p>
<p>If she chooses to clear the power of the curse, it means that she will be able to persist in the void environment for less time, and if she chooses to let go first, she can persist in the void for a longer time, but the curse will cause more damage to her.</p>
<p>Auriel is not indecisive. After thinking for a while, she chose to let the curse power go.</p>
<p>She firmly belief that Imperius and Tyrael are actively working to retrieve her from the void. If she can successfully regain access to the high-heaven, the curse afflicting the sword of Demon King Osiris will be eradicated. Conversely, should she be unable to endure an extended period within the void, risking severe erosion from its power, her return to the higher realms could potentially bring immense trouble to the material world.</p>
<p>The erosion of void power seems to cause corruption. Auriel has heard a little about this. In her opinion, the corruption of the void is much more serious than the corruption of the dark power...</p>
<p>Auriel curled up in place, wrapped her body with her light wings, and waited motionlessly. She didn&#x27;t know how long she could hold on, nor how long it would take for Imperius and Tyrael to be able to do it. Take yourself back, but as long as there is a glimmer of hope, Auriel will not give up.</p>
<p>Hope, this is her authority, she will always wait for the moment when the miracle comes...</p>
<p>When Roy found her, she saw her curled up, and naturally knew what Auriel was doing.</p>
<p>To be honest, although Roy pulled Auriel into the void at the last moment of his exile, he actually had no hatred for Auriel. It&#x27;s just a random selection of a lucky opponent. Aside from the natural hostility between angels and demons, he still admires Auriel. After all, even warriors like Imperius were blown away by him at that time. The assistant can bravely face Roy and restrain him. Such fighting will is admirable.</p>
<p>However, this is the case between angels and demons. There is no reason for hostility. If he and Auriel change their positions and become Roy, they can only stick to waiting for help and Auriel can act on her own in the void. I believe Auriel will also take action to deal with Roy without hesitation.</p>
<p>So since Auriel was discovered, Roy couldn&#x27;t let her go because of admiration... it&#x27;s just impossible.</p>
<p>Roy is not very interested in the eternal battle between angels and demons that takes place in this world. He doesn&#x27;t want to be trapped in this world and repeatedly tug-of-war with angels like Diablo and the others. But in order to end the eternal battle, one side must win. As a demon, Roy, of course, can&#x27;t turn over Mephisto and the others. In that case, he will probably not be able to get along in the abyss in the future - so he only Can play the idea of High Heaven.</p>
<p>Attacking the High Heaven is part of his plan. Now there are only three of the four archangels left. Of course, Roy can&#x27;t let Auriel go back to add obstacles to him.</p>
<p>Roy originally wanted to fly towards Auriel&#x27;s location, but then found that he couldn&#x27;t fly, flapping his wings was useless, there was no air and no space in the void, flying and flashing in the conventional sense were here is useless!</p>
<p>As a last resort, Roy could only consume a little of his reserve soul again, evolve his wings, and add the attributes of being able to fly and move in the void.</p>
<p>Now, Roy&#x27;s wings can no longer be called the Wings of the Mist, but should be called the [Wings of the Void]...</p>
<p>The void world seems to have its own set of rules. After gaining the ability to move, Roy came to Auriel&#x27;s side, but Auriel did not notice his arrival at all, and Roy floated on Auriel&#x27;s body. Beside him, he could even smell the holy light on Auriel when he lowered his head a little (if there is a smell spreading in the void), but Auriel just didn&#x27;t notice it.</p>
<p>This situation made Roy feel a little funny, but he also secretly feared that the void environment was so dangerous. The enemy was so close that he didn&#x27;t know anything about it. If you encounter any enemy, you really don&#x27;t know how to die.</p>
<p>Speaking of enemies, Roy remembered that creatures can actually be born in the void, and each of those void creatures is extremely dangerous, but I don&#x27;t know if they will encounter them in this void.</p>
<p>As he got closer, Roy only saw the wound on Auriel&#x27;s abdomen. After becoming the Demon King, the power of Frostmourne&#x27;s curse was also strengthened accordingly, so it was also effective for an archangel like Auriel, but Auriel did not choose to deal with it. This wound made Roy understand her thoughts for the first time.</p>
<p>Roy knew that she was giving priority to fighting against the erosion of the void, but Auriel didn&#x27;t seem to realize that the cursed power was also a kind of dark power in the material world, that is to say, the cursed power attached to her wound was actually eroded by the void. The curse dissipating, although it is relatively slow, but it will disappear completely.</p>
<p>As the time goes on, this curse will be cured without medicine. It can be said that Auriel has made a mistake.</p>
<p>However, this refers to the absence of external interference... and now Roy is by her side!</p>
<p>Roy knew that Auriel didn&#x27;t have any perception of the outside world, so he boldly stretched out his fingertips and released a small mass of chaotic energy at the position of Auriel&#x27;s wound, covering the wound thinly. In this way, the chaotic power is isolated, and the dissipation of the curse power stops immediately.</p>
<p>Because when Roy created Frostmourne, he made it according to the ability of Frostmourne in his memory, so those who have been hit by this corruption curse will continue to hear from their souls during the duration of the curse. Whispering sound, this murmuring sound is usually the echo of the subconscious deep in their hearts, which will continue to amplify the dark side of their hearts, increase their negative emotions, and eventually lead to the corruption and degeneration of those who are recruited.</p>
<p>Auriel is the archangel, and Roy is not sure how much effect this corruption curse has on her, but he decided to continue and slightly modified the words in the whispering voice.</p>
<p>Auriel was originally fighting against the erosion of the void, while being distracted to resist the influence of the curse, but suddenly, the whispering voice that echoed in her mind suddenly became much clearer.</p>
<p>&quot;Archangel Auriel, what are you waiting for? Waiting for your brother to rescue you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give it up, this is the void, a world the angels haven&#x27;t explored, they can&#x27;t find you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are in the depths of the void, the backside of the material world. Here, the power of the void is everywhere, but your power cannot be supplemented in any way!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The void will slowly erode you a little bit, and eventually devour you, and the power of the Holy Light you are proud of can no longer protect you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your light will eventually go out, your body will dissipate, and your soul will not be able to return to the High Heaven. Either you disappear completely, or you will be taken by the void, and then create an ugly void creature with your soul.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one can save you. The hope you hold on is empty, and miracles will not happen. When your strength is worn out bit by bit, you will also sink bit by bit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you want to escape this bitter sea, then say the name of Osiris, only he can save you, only he...&quot;</p>
<p>This sentence was so clear that it kept echoing in Auriel&#x27;s mind over and over again, repeating, although Auriel also knew that it was the influence of the curse, but she couldn&#x27;t block the murmur, you can only empty your mind as much as possible to reduce this interference.</p>
<p>Roy is not in a hurry, his curse power, left a mark on Auriel, and it is also a coordinate. The seed has been planted, and he just needs to wait for the harvest season to come...</p>
<p>Roy left, he came gently, walked gently, waved his sleeves, leaving only a tape recorder beside Auriel...</p>
