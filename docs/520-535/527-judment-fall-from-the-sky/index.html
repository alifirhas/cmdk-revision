<p>&quot;Is that so, so...&quot;</p>
<p>A brief exchange in the sky made Tyrael fully aware of the difference between Roy and several other demon kings. His intuition told Tyrael that what Roy said might indeed be true.</p>
<p>Osiris has no interest in Sanctuary, which is a good thing. Tyrael is relieved, but the other party&#x27;s high threat to the High Heaven cannot be ignored. In the light, the clothes of Tyrael&#x27;s mortal body gradually faded away, replaced by golden boots and armor full of divine breath.</p>
<p>At this moment, Tyrael regained his original appearance as an archangel, and the hood of his head became dark and hollow. He held the holy sword and pointed at Roy, and his voice sounded from all directions, saying &quot;Demon King Osiris, No matter what your intentions are, you must pass me! I, fight for the High Heaven!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, I don&#x27;t mind beating you again!&quot; Roy also showed a wicked smile.</p>
<p>The battle between Roy and Tyrael broke out again, and the shock wave of the battle ravaged the whole sky again. Tyrael desperately wanted to defeat Roy, but Roy was easily coping with his attack, and there was still time to pay attention. The siege progress of the demon army below.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t know what kind of material the huge diamond gate and the surrounding city walls are made of. They are so solid that even the attacks of lord-level demons can only leave some damage on them. These damages are repaired in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Yes, the gate of diamonds and the city wall have the ability to repair themselves. It is precisely because of this that the ground troops of the demon army have been blocked from the city wall, and there is no progress at all. Instead, the angels rely on the city wall and continue to attack. kill demons.</p>
<p>If it goes on like this, it is impossible for the demons to break into the Silver City if there is no power to make a final decision.</p>
<p>At this time, in the silver city in the distance, a crimson holy light flame could be seen rising into the sky. Imperius, who got the news, finally came out of the command post. He turned into a crimson light, towards the sky. Flying at high speed at the position where Roy and Tyrael were fighting.</p>
<p>Roy saw this scene and said nothing, but Tyrael was overjoyed because he felt the power of Imperius, and there was a brief distraction. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Roy suddenly appeared in Tyrael. On top of Tyrael&#x27;s head, a punch knocked Tyrael down from the sky.</p>
<p>boom! Tyrael&#x27;s body turned into a meteor and fell to the ground, blasting the earth into a crater. He was struggling to get up, but Roy, who was chasing, stepped on his back and stepped on his back again. Then, the Frostmourne sword in Roy&#x27;s hand was inserted, pinning Tyrael&#x27;s Light Wing to the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;stop!&quot;</p>
<p>Imperius, who came quickly, saw this scene, and he immediately roared loudly because his intuition was not good.</p>
<p>However, it was too late, Roy held his left hand into a claw shape and stabbed Tyrael&#x27;s back ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Just when the tip of his claw was about to touch Tyrael&#x27;s back, a golden crystal about the size of his fist suddenly appeared. Roy held the crystal and stabbed the sharp end directly into Tyrael&#x27;s back.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah! Damn! How is this possible!?&quot; The familiar feeling came, and even if he didn&#x27;t look back, Tyrael knew what he was stabbed by something, and there was an unbelievable tone in his voice, saying &quot;It&#x27;s the Bright Soul Stone!? This is impossible! Why do you still have it!?&quot;</p>
<p>That&#x27;s right, what pierced Tyrael&#x27;s back was the Bright Soul Stone, and it was the second one!</p>
<p>&quot;Why is it not possible?&quot; Roy lowered his head to Tyrael while inspiring the power in the crystal and began to absorb Tyrael&#x27;s soul &quot;Who told you that I made a bright soul stone? Let me tell you, There are several archangels in the High Heaven, and I actually made a few!&quot;</p>
<p>It can only be said that traditional thinking kills people. Tyrael knows the dark soul stone very well, because there is only one fragment of the world stone, so only one dark soul stone can be made. When he discovered that the light soul stone was actually could imprison angel souls like the dark soul stone, he subconsciously thought that there was only one bright soul stone.</p>
<p>The soul stone that imprisoned him before has been temporarily placed in the High Heaven by them, so when he fought with Roy, he was not prepared for Roy&#x27;s move at all.</p>
<p>With the unwilling roar, Tyrael&#x27;s soul turned into countless golden rays of light, which was inhaled by the crystal, and his angel body also turned into rays of light and dissipated.</p>
<p>&quot;Archangel Tyrael, do you regret that you are not a Saint Seiya now?&quot; Roy said a stalk that does not exist in this world, so he put away the bright soul stone in his hand, and then raised Frostmourne in his hand.</p>
<p>clang!</p>
<p>There was a loud noise, and the spear of courage full of Imperius&#x27; anger and flames slammed into Frostmourne&#x27;s sword. Imperius roared, pushing Roy&#x27;s body with all his strength. Roy pushed out a distance of several hundred meters and Roy&#x27;s feet also cut two deep ravines on the ground.</p>
<p>Imperius was exhausted in the end. Roy blocked him with a backhand and then fought with Imperius.</p>
<p>&quot;I KILL YOU, I KILL YOU!&quot; Imperius roared while wielding the spear of courage to keep attacking. Under his golden covering mask, the position of his eyes had turned into red raging flames.</p>
<p>I hope that the angel Auriel is gone and can&#x27;t come back from far away in the void. Now even Tyrael is imprisoned in the Bright Soul Stone again. All of this happened in front of Imperius, but Imperius There is absolutely no power to prevent this from happening, how could he be as proud as Imperius, how could he accept such a thing?</p>
<p>Looking at Imperius, who was so angry, Roy&#x27;s heart moved.</p>
<p>Why do we often hear stories of angels falling in every world? Is it because the angels, who represent goodness and purity, are not as powerful as the demons?</p>
<p>This is not the case. In fact, the real reason is often because the angel&#x27;s own emotions are out of control! Angels are also intelligent creatures and naturally have a variety of emotions. Although most of the time their emotions are positive and positive, it does not mean that they will not have negative emotions.</p>
<p>Of course, it is normal to have negative emotions. As long as the angels calm down in time, they can easily control these negative emotions, and often this level of negative emotions cannot be used by demons.</p>
<p>But if the negativity gets too heavy and starts to spin out of control and go to extremes, that&#x27;s another story!</p>
<p>The power of holy light is often based on positive emotions. The stronger the positive emotions, the stronger the power of the holy light, and the extreme negative emotions will destroy the cornerstone of the holy light in their bodies, then makes the angels lose control of the power of the Holy Light.</p>
<p>Therefore, the fall of angels is sometimes not necessarily caused by demons, but caused by their own out of control...</p>
<p>Imperius is like this now. The successive defeats and setbacks are constantly destroying the pride and self-esteem in Imperius&#x27;s heart. Anger is constantly growing in his heart and Imperius is eager for revenge and loses his calmness. Imperius&#x27;s going more extreme. The seemingly constant attack is not a manifestation of courage and fighting will, but has become... reckless and aggressive!</p>
<p>Imperius didn&#x27;t notice his change, but Roy noticed it. When he was fighting Imperius, he found that although the holy flame on his body continued to rise, the power of the holy light was actually declining. The Holy Light energy attached to the spear was not as good as the attack at the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;Interesting...&quot; Roy smiled and thought to himself &quot;High Heaven has fallen to a Malthael, is it Imperius&#x27;s turn now? Does he still want to get ahead of Auriel?&quot;</p>
<p>While Roy continued to fight with Imperius, he observed carefully. He found that Imperius was indeed the first person in the High Heaven. Although there were signs of degeneration, the power of the Holy Light was still flowing continuously. His body overflowed and it seemed that he was still a little too hot to complete the last step.</p>
<p>&quot;Forget it, let me witness the fall of the High Heaven!&quot; Roy thought so, slammed into Imperius and knocked him out.</p>
<p>After that, Roy returned to the state of chaotic body again, his body began to be filled with mist again, and his height was also rising.</p>
<p>After once again turning into a huge demon with a height of several hundred meters, Roy flicked his hand and a powerful chaotic force flew out and smashed on Imperius who was rushing up again.</p>
<p>This time, the chaotic force directly disintegrated the holy light on Imperius&#x27; body, hit his angel body, and the ball of light condensed by the chaotic power pushed Imperius back at a high speed, and finally blasted him directly to the silver city in the distance. above the city walls.</p>
<p>With a scream, Imperius was smashed into the city wall, and with the impact point as the center, the sturdy city wall appeared spider web-like cracks.</p>
<p>Seeing that Imperius could not stand up for a short time, Roy took a deep breath. He stood on the spot, raised his right hand high, and the magic spread out, forming a circle on the ground under his feet. The ring ripples spread out.</p>
<p>In the ripples of magic power, a huge magic circle with shimmering light was formed, and with the help of this magic circle, Roy&#x27;s perception also reached the sky!</p>
<p>On the battlefield of the Silver City, a gust of wind suddenly blew and the clouds above began to stir, forming an eye of the storm with a diameter of about ten kilometers. In the swirling cloud layer, a ray of light suddenly lit up, Illuminated the entire cloud.</p>
<p>All the angels and demons on the battlefield looked at the sky in unison, and they felt a heart-wrenching and terrifying aura coming from it.</p>
<p>The cloud layer in the center of the vortex suddenly opened, as if the sky had opened an eye, revealing the glowing object behind the cloud layer.</p>
<p>It was a huge meteorite with a diameter of over two kilometers!</p>
<p>With a flaming flame, it dragged a long tail like a comet, and it fell straight down from the sky. In the desperate eyes of the angels and the fearful eyes of the demons, it flew towards the location of the Diamond Gate. go!</p>
<p>The entire High Heaven was resounding with the huge roar caused by the friction between the meteorite and the air, and in this roar, the icy voice of Demon King Osiris.</p>
<p>&quot;Doomsday... Judgment!&quot;</p>
