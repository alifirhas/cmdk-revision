<p>What does God Anu&#x27;s Crest look like?</p>
<p>Before coming to the High Heaven, Roy had seen this word in the books of mortals more than once. However, since ancient times, few mortals can really go to the High Heaven, so for the The description of God Anu&#x27;s crystal arch all of it almost derived from the imagination of mortals.</p>
<p>God Anu&#x27;s Crest, it&#x27;s not a real crest, but a super crystal whose size is beyond everyone&#x27;s imagination!</p>
<p>How big is it? Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s more than three kilometers in height! Not to mention the width, in fact, after arriving at the crystal dome, Roy was able to get a glimpse of its whole picture.</p>
<p>The so-called crystal dome is actually just a platform or platform built on the top of the entire crystal. Part of the floor is hollowed out and the God Anu&#x27;s Crest Crystal has two symmetrical forks from the hollowed out. The ground stretches out and it seems that the platform is inlaid on the crystal. The angels of the High Heaven, in order to set off the grandeur of this crystal dome, even stood several equally tall angels on both sides of the road leading to the viewing platform. Statue, when Roy walked all the way, these angel statues seemed to pay attention to him.</p>
<p>Standing on the observation deck, you can see some vague scenes below, which are the buildings in the Silver City of High Heaven, but at this height, these buildings appear very small, and occasionally you can see some small black spots Fly over, it&#x27;s the flying demons and monsters that are ravaging the city.</p>
<p>But on the observation deck, the most conspicuous is the crystal of God Anu&#x27;s Crest. Perhaps it is a visual error caused by light. If you look at the crystal arch from the ground, you will see that the crystal emits a green light, but it is really here. Later, Roy discovered that the crystal was actually golden!</p>
<p>The crystal lacks any signs of polishing, giving it a rough appearance on the surface. The upper half of the crystal maintains a solid shape, but the lower half forks and splits into two columns, providing support for the entire crystal. This might explain the bifurcated structure of the crystal arch. However, in Roy&#x27;s perspective, the crystal doesn&#x27;t resemble a pillar but rather resembles a tooth with its root.</p>
<p>Especially when looking at the rugged section at the top, it looks more like a molar...</p>
<p>Roy was filled with a strong urge to express his disbelief. The ancient legend seemed too far-fetched to be true. He couldn&#x27;t see any resemblance between the crystal and the vertebra of the God of Creation. If it were truly a vertebra, then what kind of creature was God Anu, the creator, to possess such a massive bone?</p>
<p>Observing the towering height of the crystal, Roy contemplated that if it indeed belonged to a vertebra, the creature associated with it must be at least ten kilometers tall! Imagining a humanoid being of such proportions standing upright on the planet&#x27;s surface, their head would breach the troposphere!</p>
<p>Considering the enormity of such a creature, Roy concluded that no other beings could exist alongside it, except for Titans...</p>
<p>Of course, perhaps the creator God Anu in this myth and legend is indeed a titan, perhaps even a star soul titan. After all, in many world creation legends, the creator gods are suspected to be titans, such as the two in the world of Ashan. The God of Creation, Asha and Urgash are, so if the God of Creation in this Diablo world is also a Titan, it would be reasonable.</p>
<p>I just don&#x27;t know what this titan looks like to have such a vertebra. Roy now thinks that this crystal might just be a tooth of a certain star soul titan, which is more reliable...</p>
<p>While the crystal may not resemble a vertebra, its presence exudes an immensely potent divine energy. The golden light emitted by the crystal is not blinding but rather restrained, yet it is apparent that even lower-ranked demons would find it extremely challenging to approach the crystal closely.</p>
<p>Roy flew up and observed around the crystal for a while, and found that all the divine power was concentrated inside the crystal. When these divine powers were working, a unique humming sound came from the whole crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;Strange, this crystal...&quot; Roy rubbed his chin and asked suspiciously, &quot;Why does it look like some kind of device in operation?&quot;</p>
<p>The reason why he thinks this way is because Roy can perceive the angel souls stored in the crystal. These souls are flowing slowly inside the crystal, and some changes are taking place at the same time. The souls seem to be being merged and reorganized.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s like a... factory?&quot; Roy tried to find a suitable adjective &quot;Or... a repair shop? The restored soul, when the crystal is drilled out, takes away a little bit of the divine power in the crystal, Can you create a new angel&#x27;s body?&quot;</p>
<p>It is no wonder that this place is called the birthplace of angels. The complex mechanism inside the crystal does not look like the function of natural crystal. Even if the crystal is really the remains of the creator God Anu, this function It could not have been there from the beginning. Roy felt that this might be a function added by the angels in the later stage. They just used the characteristics of this crystal.</p>
<p>In any case, as long as this crystal is still there, angels will be born continuously. If you want to completely destroy the angels, you must destroy this crystal.</p>
<p>Pulling out Frostmourne, Roy tried to cut a sword on the crystal, but when the sword fell, the crystal was not damaged in the slightest and  Roy&#x27;s sword was shaken and trembling. Roy changed to another method to attack, then found the firmness of this crystal is beyond imagination!</p>
<p>Roy somewhat understands why Diablo chose to corrupt this crystal last time, because it is estimated that he can&#x27;t hurt this crystal.</p>
<p>But if Roy is to use his own dark power to corrupt the crystal like Diablo, because it is too slow, it waste too much time. The endless divine power, if this method is used, it can be said that 99% of the dark power is used for consumption, and the real internal corruption is only 1%.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, Roy raised his right hand and a black fog circled in his palm. In this fog, there were countless desolate viruses. They swallowed Roy&#x27;s magic power and began to multiply rapidly. It increased exponentially. After Roy felt that the number was about the same, he waved his hand gently, and he immediately swayed these desolate viruses out, covering a small area on the crystal.</p>
<p>These desolate viruses, which can rapidly multiply by swallowing energy, fall on the crystal, like a mouse falling into a rice vat. They don&#x27;t care whether the energy in the crystal is the power of holy light or not. For the desolate virus, it is all It is energy that can be swallowed, so in the blink of an eye, the Desolation Virus began to multiply desperately.</p>
<p>Initially, there was a small black spot on the crystal&#x27;s surface. However, within a minute, the size of the black spot had doubled, and its expansion rate accelerated rapidly. The black spot continued to spread outward, increasing its area at an increasingly rapid pace.</p>
<p>Due to the rapid proliferation, many desolate viruses piled up together, even formed a sticky feeling. As the Creep of the Desolation Virus spreads, the Holy Light power in the crystal is constantly being absorbed. These Holy Light powers did not fight against the dark power, but directly swallowed up. This kind of efficiency can be said to be more than ten times faster.</p>
<p>Roy floated in the air and waited with his arms crossed. He suspected that the reason why the crystal was so strong was because the power of the Holy Light contained in it was too large. After the energy density was reduced, the firmness of the crystal might decrease. Time to destroy.</p>
<p>But at this moment, in a fiery red light, a figure rushed into the crystal dome, that was Imperius, he rushed into the dome with a roar, and went straight to Roy!</p>
<p>With a loud bang, Solarion&#x27;s spear blade slashed at Frostmourne!</p>
<p>Roy held his sword and Imperius held held his gun blade, the grinned at him &quot;What? Are you here to witness the collapse of the crystal arch?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot; Imperius&#x27;s eyes were burning with raging flames under his visor, while he increased his strength to overwhelm Roy, he said filially to Roy &quot;As long as I am here, don&#x27;t even think about anything!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Come on then!&quot; Roy didn&#x27;t care, and said, &quot;Although I don&#x27;t know what the damn Mephisto is doing and let you go, but the result is the same...&quot;</p>
<p>The two began to dance and fight in the crystal dome. Imperius was desperate, so Roy also fought seriously. Every collision between the two brought huge energy shock wave, and these energy waves spread. Going out and impacting the surrounding space, all kinds of solid buildings around it are also constantly cracking.</p>
<p>Not long after the battle, the entire silver tower trembled. At first, Imperius thought it was caused by the battle, but then he realized that something was wrong. He looked down and found that the upper part of the crystal of God Anu&#x27;s Crest had been destroyed by that A sticky black creep is covered!</p>
<p>How can it be so fast!? Imperius was startled and wanted to rush over to purify those black mushrooms, but was intercepted by Roy halfway through, making him roar again and again in a hurry.</p>
<p>After a while, the shaking of the silver tower became more and more violent. At this time, Roy and Imperius were able to confirm that this should be caused by the attenuation of energy in the crystal. The God Anu&#x27;s Crest Crystal is the cornerstone of the crystal arch, it is its energy that supports the entire magnificent arch. Once this energy disappears, the arch will not be able to support it.</p>
<p>Imperius has never been so eager. At this moment, he can no longer care about fighting with Roy, but wants to save the crystal, but Roy has been obstructing him. In the end, Imperius was in a hurry. With a flick of his hand, he shot his spear of courage towards Roy.</p>
<p>However, at this time, Roy just turned his back to the crystal. He flashed lightly, and the spear of courage brushed past him. The spear of courage that was shot quickly turned into a streamer and stabbed the crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;Kacha&quot;, it made a soft sound, and the crystal, which was originally too strong to be chopped, was actually pierced by the spear of courage for a short period!</p>
<p>Imperius and Roy was also stunned, because both of them saw that a crack appeared at the position where the spear of courage was pierced!</p>
<p>The crack continued to expand in a clack and soon spread over the entire crystal surface. Even the stickiness of the desolate virus blanket could not prevent the crack from expanding.</p>
<p>&quot;Imperius... You are the one who did this!&quot; Roy looked back at him and said a very heartbreaking sentence &quot;God Anu&#x27;s crest was broken by your own hands... Pfft!&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this sentence, Imperius couldn&#x27;t bear it any longer. He fell from mid-air to his knees on the platform.</p>
<p>He stared blankly at the expanding crack, then suddenly held his helmet with both hands and let out a heart-piercing howl.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not! Don&#x27;t be like this!&quot;</p>
<p>Under Roy&#x27;s gaze, Imperius, who was full of anger and had nowhere to express his remorse, the huge fiery red wing behind him began to change little by little, turning into pitch black like ink...</p>
<p>Imperius, consumed by a mix of incompetence and rage, found himself responsible for the very thing he was meant to protect: its destruction. Overwhelmed by negative emotions, he took a final, desperate step. The darkness within him surged, intensifying and conflicting with his original holy light power. A wretched howl escaped his lips as his once radiant wings became engulfed in dark flames. The golden archangel armor on his body strained under tremendous pressure from all sides, producing ominous cracking sounds and violently collapsing inward.</p>
<p>In just over ten seconds, Imperius&#x27;s entire armor collapsed into a pile of scrap iron, even the elemental body inside the armor was squeezed. The burning black light wings covered it. It landed on this pile of scrap iron and ignited it. With the burning of this black flame, the armor finally turned into fly ash.</p>
<p>A gust of air blew past, raising countless dust...</p>
<p>Imperius just died like this. Even the soul did not fly to the crystal, but dissipated and decomposed together. Roy watched this scene without saying a word. Roy though Imperius will degenerate into a dark archangel, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to end like this.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m afraid that this proud guy will not allow himself to fall, so he just chooses to perish completely...</p>
<p>After three seconds of silence mourning for Imperius&#x27;s death, Roy turned his head and raised Frostmourne, like throwing a flying knife, Roy threw Frostmourne towards the crystal. When the sword tip hit the crystal, stabbed in like a broken bamboo, the already broken crystal couldn&#x27;t hold it any longer. The whole crystal exploded in a world-shattering explosion and the intense light spread out from the top of the silver tower, instantly illuminating the entire High Heaven!</p>
<p>As if a new sun appeared in the High Heaven, illuminating the entire sky, and with the appearance of this light, the magnificent crystal arch that stood tall began to collapse...</p>
