        <span>522: Battle of Power and Power</span>
    </h1>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>Countless demons and monsters swarmed from the many open portals like a flood.</p>
<p>Except for some of these demons that were directly summoned from the Hell of Flames, the rest almost came from all over the Sanctuary. Diablo and the seven demon kings have been operating in the Sanctuary world for many years, leaving behind the dark power A large number of creatures have been corrupted, resulting in an astonishing number of monsters formed. The Imps that Roy spread out at the beginning stayed in the wilderness. Once the portal was opened, these guys were attracted.</p>
<p>Even ordinary monsters, out of disgust for the power of the Holy Light, after they came to the High Heaven, they involuntarily launched a charge with the demons. Such a large number of demons and monsters gathered together, and the pollution caused by the dark power was Very terrifying, these dark forces in turn stimulated their bloodthirsty instincts, so on the battlefield, the army of the dark camp was seen frantically launching a tsunami-like attack wave against the silver city.</p>
<p>bump! A sound came, and the moment the army of demons and monsters rushed to the city wall of the Silver City, it immediately inspired the protective barrier of the entire Silver City, and the golden holy light formed a huge semi-circular protective barrier in the blink of an eye. The shield covered the entire city, and it was this shield that the demons and monsters collided with for the first time.</p>
<p>However, the shield proved inadequate in repelling the relentless onslaught of demons and monsters. Those creatures scorched by the holy light found themselves trapped with no means of escape. Pressed by the ceaseless tide of advancing monsters, their only recourse was to engage in frenzied combat, wielding weapons or resorting to biting with razor-sharp teeth and claws. Meanwhile, certain magical entities bombarded the shield with a barrage of spells and projectiles, employing every possible method to breach the protective barrier of light.</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s Imps are scattered over the entire battlefield, which is equivalent to surrounding the entire silver city in all directions. This way, it has larger contact area. The first contact and attack the shield of the Holy Light enchantment. The more demons and monsters there are, even if the protective ability of the Holy Light Barrier in the Silver City is very strong, when facing so many monsters attacking at the same time, the energy will drop rapidly for a while.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at this time, the angel army in the silver city also reacted. A large number of angel warriors waved their light wings, flew high into the sky with weapons in their hands, and rushed over the city wall to the demons and monsters outside. In order to reduce the pressure on the barrier, They can only place the battlefield outside the enchantment.</p>
<p>However, doing this means that they can no longer enjoy the protection of the enchantment. The armies of both sides fought on the battlefield with real swords and guns. Every moment, you can see the splashing out of demons and monsters when they are cut open. Flesh and blood, you can also see the scene of the angel dissipating into light after being besieged.</p>
<p>The battle, from the very beginning, entered a state of intense heat...</p>
<p>Imperius and Tyrael wanted to command the army to fight, especially Imperius, he was the supreme commander of the entire High Heaven, but before he could call for an order, they were entangled by Roy.</p>
<p>After changing his passive defensive stance, Roy started to take the initiative to attack this time. The huge misty wing behind him slammed into the ground, and they saw the overwhelming black flames appear in the entire sky, the black flames dissipated. Clouds and mists within a few thousand meters rolled towards the four archangels.</p>
<p>If they dare to dodge, this huge cloud of hellfire will smash into the barrier shield of the Silver City, so Imperius and the others can only choose to join forces to block these clouds of hellfire, they inspired their respective archangel weapons, A circular shield was formed in the air, blocking the path of the hellfire cloud.</p>
<p>The flames hit their golden shields of holy light, darkness and holy power collided, and a huge shock wave erupted. Some demons and monsters that got close were instantly burnt to ashes, fluttering in the sky and unable to escape. The angels also turned into light with a painful roar and even their armor was melted into liquid and dripped to the ground.</p>
<p>It was just a collision of force, and the tens of kilometers in which the two sides were fighting had been completely emptied. The demons avoided this area in fear and the angels also flew around this area as soon as possible. There were no creatures at all that dare to approach.</p>
<p>Relying on the power of the Holy Light, the four archangels neutralized the waves of hellfire set off by Roy. However, before they could catch their breath, a ball of thunder light thrown by Roy erupted in mid-air. Countless black filaments of lightning flashed erupted in a circular area. This is a spiritual storm imitating the skills of the [2] Protoss Archon. The dark lightning power directly to the soul continues to rage in this area and there are countless lightning every second. The shield of light that bombarded the four archangels.</p>
<p>Imperius and the others were struggling to support it, but this mental storm lasted for more than five minutes before it finally dissipated. Protecting these black lightnings consumes more energy than protecting ordinary lightning. When the storm dissipated, it could be seen that the four archangels and even the light wings behind them were darkened a lot.</p>
<p>Raising their heads, the four archangels discovered that they were surrounded by a mist that flowed like ink and wash on Roy&#x27;s body, as if they had entered Roy&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>&quot;Not good! Rush out quickly!&quot; Imperius shouted, leading Tyrael, Auriel and Itherael to find a direction and to break through. After rushed for a short distance, the front Roy&#x27;s demon king&#x27;s face suddenly appeared in the fog and three gray rays of light burst out from his three demon eyes, hitting Tyrael, Auriel, and Itherael behind Imperius.</p>
<p>This gray light was emitted at the speed of light, so fast that it was too late for people to react. The Holy Light shield that Auriel and the other three were directly penetrated by the gray light, and the light hit directly. Their bodies caused a strong explosion, which directly blew the three back and flew out.</p>
<p>Imperius, who was flew alone, looked back and saw this scene. Before he had time to check the situation of the three, he quickly turned his head and blocked with the spear of courage in front of him.</p>
<p>A huge misty claw clenched into a fist and slammed into Imperius&#x27;s gun barrel. At the moment of the hit, the fist turned into a solid body, followed by a powerful burst of power, and the huge body strengthened Roy&#x27;s power, after being doubled by Red Dragon Emperor gauntlet, formed an irresistible powerful force shock! The barrel of the Gun of Courage was bent 90 degrees at the moment it was hit. The barrel hit Imperius&#x27; chest, and the force passed on collapsed the armor on Imperius&#x27; chest. Knocking Imperius into the air in an instant!</p>
<p>The whole battlefield was watched the angels and demons, they all saw that Imperius was knocked out of the mist formed by Roy&#x27;s body, turned into a streamer and shot directly into the sky, and disappeared like a star.</p>
<p>It is conservatively estimated that Roy&#x27;s blow can send him hundreds of kilometers away, which is beyond the horizon of most creatures...</p>
<p>&quot;Dammit!&quot;</p>
<p>After Auriel was blown away by the gray light, the first time she woke up, she saw the image of Imperius being knocked away. Her calm and harmonious voice couldn&#x27;t help but change and she charged with a long sword and a long spear. When Roy was approaching the mist, the rope of hope that was wrapped around her arms suddenly increased in length, wrapping around Roy&#x27;s huge mist body from both sides.</p>
<p>As if the length of these long ropes can be extended indefinitely, they rotate rapidly, entangling Roy&#x27;s huge body, and at the same time the entire rope of hope</p>
<p>There is also a blue light on it. These blue light forms a power similar to an enchantment, which blocks the emission of Roy&#x27;s misty body and binds the invisible and intangible mist within the bounds of the entanglement.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot; Roy was also a little surprised. He didn&#x27;t expect Auriel to have such a trick. At this moment, Roy was like being enclosed and his misty body was trapped in a Inside the human-shaped body, he couldn&#x27;t get out of it for a while.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tyrael also roared and flew over. He held the brilliance of the holy feather in his hand, and stabbed the sword through the gap in the rope of hope. He gathered the powerful holy light at the tip of the sword, and then Inside this mortal body, the power of the Holy Light was directly detonated!</p>
<p><em><strong>Boom!</strong></em></p>
<p>The holy light that condensed all the power of an archangel broke out and countless golden rays of light leaked out from the gaps in the rope of hope, making this mortal body that bound Roy like an object that leaked light from all sides, and then It was an earth-shattering explosion!</p>
<p>However, with all the explosive force, Auriel, who was supported by her gnashing teeth, was bound in the body of the Cord of Hope, which aggravated the destructive power of the Holy Light.</p>
<p>&quot;Does it work?&quot; Auriel waited until the explosion passed, and asked Tyrael, who was still holding the sword inserted into the humanoid body.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t know...&quot; Tyrael was not sure and shook his head &quot;Would you like to open it and take a look?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it can&#x27;t be opened!&quot; Itherael&#x27;s voice came: &quot;I saw the picture of him getting out of trouble...&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Tyrael cursed &quot;Damn! Do it again!&quot;</p>
<p>However, before the words fell, the husk formed by the rope of hope moved. Tyrael&#x27;s neck was pinched by the right hand raised by the husk, and a mass of curse flames rose from where Tyrael was pinched. Get up and start burning Tyrael&#x27;s head!</p>
<p>Tyrael was desperately clenching the wrist of the body, trying to break free from the restraint, but the power from this hand was so great that he couldn&#x27;t break free for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Auriel, what&#x27;s going on!?&quot; Itherael asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;He... he is resisting the binding force of the Hope Cord!&quot; Auriel said with difficulty, she was trying her best to control her Hope Cord, but the resistance from the inside was getting stronger and stronger and she was already at her limit.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on!&quot; Itherael shouted, flapping his wings and flying to where Tyrael and Roy were. The scroll of fate he was holding changed into a golden hammer at this moment. He swung the heavy hammer vigorously and smashed it on the wrist of the humanoid body. With the percussion of the ground and the cooperation of Auriel, Tyrael was finally rescued.</p>
<p>Only then did Tyrael use the power of the Holy Light to completely extinguish the flames that burning on his face, but after a while, Tyrael&#x27;s face was burned beyond recognition. Formed into a group, the humanoid husks that were struggling to fight for control with Auriel didn&#x27;t know how to attack for a while.</p>
<p>However, at this moment, Auriel&#x27;s hollow hood suddenly lit up with light like eyes, and she seemed to have received some kind of revelation, shouting to Itherael &quot;Exile him! I see he can be banished! &quot;</p>
<p>After Itherael and Tyrael heard the shouts, they didn&#x27;t even think about it. One held the pierced sword hilt, the other turned the scroll of fate into a scepter and pressed it on the humanoid body, and the two At the same time, the man chanted the exorcism incantation.</p>
<p>Banishing spells, also known as banishing spells, to be honest, neither Tyrael nor Itherael have used this trick for a long time. If it wasn&#x27;t for Auriel&#x27;s reminder, they would have forgotten about it. This move, but Auriel should have seen a &#x27;miracle&#x27; before letting them do it, so the two chose to believe in Auriel without hesitation.</p>
<p>Although the real name of Roy&#x27;s demon was not known, the two archangels joined forces to forcefully banish him, and the incantation still had its effect. The bound humanoid body began to become illusory. It will be repelled by the material world and then exiled into the void.</p>
<p>Back then, Lilith was exiled by Inarius like this...</p>
<p>Seeing that the body became illusory, Auriel was also ready to cut off her own rope of hope. Although doing so would lose part of the rope of hope, it might even destroy the archangel weapon, but in order to achieve her goal, she was still prepared to do so.</p>
<p>But at this time, a sudden change occurred, and a huge force came, which suddenly pulled Auriel and flew her over. Although the rope of hope was wrapped around Roy&#x27;s misty body, but the source It was also pulling Auriel. Under Roy&#x27;s tremendous strength, Auriel was pulled in front of Roy, and before Tyrael and the others could react to stop it, a ferocious long sword suddenly appeared in front of him and into Roy&#x27;s hands.</p>
<p>Frostmourne!</p>
<p>With a screeching sound, the tip of Frostmourne&#x27;s sword pierced into Auriel&#x27;s abdomen, and the angel exorcism spell on the sword was also activated!</p>
<p>&quot;Come with me, Angle of Hope -  Auriel...&quot; Roy&#x27;s grinning voice came out from his mouth and Auriel&#x27;s body also became illusory after being stabbed.</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t you dare!&quot;</p>
<p>Auriel and Itherael let out a roar at the same time, trying to reach out to grab Auriel, but it was too late, Roy and Auriel disappeared in front of them...</p>
