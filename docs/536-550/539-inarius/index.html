<p>&quot;…&quot;</p>
<p>After hearing Mephisto&#x27;s words, Roy was speechless for a while, and couldn&#x27;t help but complain &quot;Mephisto, is your brain rotten? Since you have already seen the picture of the Seven Demon Kings being killed by Lilith, you still want to take action against Sanctuary? Have you ever thought that maybe it was because of your actions against Sanctuary that Lilith&#x27;s revenge was provoked?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, Osiris!&quot; Mephisto shook his finger at Roy and said, &quot;You may have made a mistake, it wasn&#x27;t that we attacked Sanctuary to get Lilith revenge. In fact, no matter if we let go Sanctuary or not, Lilith will take revenge on us regardless! Don&#x27;t forget, she is a traitor!&quot;</p>
<p>After being reminded by Mephisto, Roy suddenly reacted, yes, Lilith&#x27;s identity on the devil&#x27;s side is still a traitor.</p>
<p>&quot;Lilith was exiled twice. The last time she emerged from the void, the conflict between her and both Hell and Heaven had reached an irreconcilable state. Lilith deep hatred for both angels and demons, is driven by her own maternal instincts. Following her return from the void, she sought revenge, but she is weak at the time. In an attempt to harness the strength of her children, the Nephalems, she underestimated the resilience of humanity. Her offspring rebelled against their own mother, like a rebellious stage. For that, Lilith got banished to the void once again.&quot;</p>
<p>Roy had nothing to say when he heard this. Although he felt a bit pity about Lilith&#x27;s circumstances at that time. After going through all these things, Lilith is nothing but a ghost. So Mephisto is right, no matter whether the Burning Hell will attack Sanctuary or not, after Lilith returns, she will definitely take revenge on Burning Hell. Of course, the original High Heaven is also within the scope of Lilith&#x27;s revenge, but Because of Roy&#x27;s intervention, Lilith now has one less target for revenge.</p>
<p>Mephisto continued &quot;My brother and I both knew that Lilith would return one day, and we were prepared for her revenge. Before you came to this world Osiris, if we follow normal development, we may really fall into Lilith&#x27;s hands, so in order to prevent this from happening, I finally thought of a way...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For example, introducing me as a variable?&quot; Roy nodded, showing his understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, a new variable!&quot; Mephisto said &quot;The so-called picture of the future segment is actually just a prophecy. It is only a possibility in the long river of time. There is a probability that it will happen and some probability may not happen, so it is not inevitable, as long as enough external variables are added to it, it will cause changes in the probability of future.&quot;</p>
<p>Roy thought for a moment, then glanced at Mephisto with deep meaning, and said quietly &quot;Are you so sure that my appearance will change your future destiny, not cause the opposite effect?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reverse effect? ​​What do you mean?&quot; Mephisto laughed sullenly &quot;It means that because of your joining, we were killed by Lilith instead? Impossible, I&#x27;m sure, Even if Lilith comes back this time, she has already been polluted by the void. I don&#x27;t know how serious the corrosion, even though she can suppress it with her own ability, but once she came to Burning Hell and faces us, She will be powerless to suppress the her Void Pollution. At that time will lose her mind and become a void monster, everything in the material world will become her enemy, including you, Osiris!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you don&#x27;t want to be swallowed by a void monster, you can only help us kill her!&quot; Mephisto&#x27;s shining demon pupil stared at Roy &quot;Otherwise, all of us... will die!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy turned his head and looked at Diablo and Baal, and found that everyone nodded slightly in agreement with Mephisto&#x27;s words.</p>
<p>So Roy stopped talking, just nodded, but he had a mind buried in his heart</p>
<p>&quot;Then have you ever thought about what if the void pollution could be resolved?&quot;</p>
<p>This is not to blame for Mephisto and the others. It is not because of their short-sightedness. In fact, with Mephisto&#x27;s long lifespan, this old guy has seen too many things. Otherwise, he will not know that the void is eroding him. It&#x27;s just that compared to Lilith, a demon who has been trying to find a solution to the erosion of the void, Mephisto&#x27;s habitual thinking is that there is no solution to the erosion of the void.</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t study, you won&#x27;t understand. Mephisto is confident that after these words, Roy will definitely stand with them to deal with Lilith. There are eight demon kings in the Burning Hell and each one of their power is unprecedentedly powerful, even for Lilith to handle by herself. Mephisto couldn&#x27;t make roy work together, so now he wanted to forcibly put Roy into their situation.</p>
<p>But Mephisto would not have thought that Roy and Lilith would have a natural possibility of joining forces...</p>
<p>Although he was still chatting and arguing with Mephisto and the others in Burning Hells, Roy was actually thinking about the possibility of jumping back...</p>
<p>Seeing that Roy was also nodding, Mephisto thought he agreed with what he said, so he continued with a bit of pride &quot;Of course, considering that Lilith may have hidden some power that we have not known, so in the in the next invasion of Sanctuary, there is no need for all of us to rush to show up for the time being, I have a better candidate here!&quot;</p>
<p>After that, Mephisto stood up from the dark throne. He waved his hand lightly and moved away the huge cornerstone of the throne, then Roy saw a faintly glowing fire on the cliff behind the cornerstone.</p>
<p>Diablo and Baal knew what Mephisto was going to do, so they also stood up. They each shrank their bodies, and followed Mephisto into the hidden cave one after another.</p>
<p>Roy naturally followed him in. As he walked, he observed the situation in the cave and found that a long staircase went straight down here, which seemed to lead to the depths of the ground.</p>
<p>&quot;Mephisto, where are you taking us?&quot; Roy asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Secret interrogation room! A place used to hold important prisoners!&quot; Mephisto replied without turning his head &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, you will understand when you get there!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy didn&#x27;t speak and followed the demon kings all the way down, and he didn&#x27;t know how long he walked. Finally, he found that there was a dazzling fire in front of him and it was estimated that he had reached the place.</p>
<p>After walking down the stairs, Roy eyes suddenly brightened. What appeared in front of Roy was a huge cave space, which was a huge sinkhole. The bottom of the sinkhole was constantly rolling high-temperature magma, and the scorching air was full of it. It is a poisonous gas with a stench and in the center of this lava lake, a stone pillar stands there.</p>
<p>Although this stone pillar is higher than the magma level, it is shorter than the position where Roy and the others are standing now. It is easy to see the scene at the top of the stone pillar.</p>
<p>A cluster of crystals emerges, encircling a full 360 degrees. Standing tall, these crystals form a ring, with an angel at its center, bound by countless chains. The angel&#x27;s once radiant wings now lay broken, their light extinguished. Limbs severed, the angel is trapped in a mortal form, while the chains siphon away their power relentlessly. A worn and ghastly visage hides beneath the hood, while the surrounding crystals reflect a pair of lidless eyes, fixed in a wild and desperate gaze. The angel is forced to confront their own visage, trapped within the reflective surfaces of these crystals.</p>
<p>Inarius! Roy reacted at once.</p>
<p>Mephisto then confirmed Roy&#x27;s guess, saying &quot;Yes, the candidate I said is Inarius, once the advisor of the High Heaven Angiris Council and the deputy of the Archangel of Justice Tyrael, The creator of Sanctuary, and now a tragic outcast, I believe Lilith will be happy to see her husband in front of her when she returns?&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing Mephisto&#x27;s words, the other six demon kings couldn&#x27;t help but laugh awkwardly, especially when they saw the miserable appearance of Inarius, who could only wriggle, their hearts were filled with incomparable joy.</p>
<p>Roy did not speak and observed Inarius&#x27; condition. He found that Inarius had actually fallen. It seemed that long-term imprisonment and torture had wiped out his mind. Roy saw fear and pain in him. , hatred and other negative emotions, but only without his own thoughts, the power emanating from this former archangel is completely dark now, which is already a manifestation of a fallen angel.</p>
<p>In addition, there is another kind of power in Inarius, Roy can see it after a little discrimination, that is... the power of death!</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, he frowned and asked Mephisto, &quot;Malthael?&quot;</p>
<p>Mephisto nodded approvingly and said, &quot;That&#x27;s right! It&#x27;s Malthael, to be precise, his Mobius Mark! After the high heavens destroyed the angel of death, Malthael, they didn&#x27;t find him. The soul returned to the crystal arch, so they thought he had completely died out, but they ignored a question, how could death itself still die? At that time, although Malthael body collapsed, his the Mobius Mark representing death still remained, and the remaining soul was also under the protection of this Mobius Mark. My clone took some time to find him in a ruined place outside the city of Westmarch. Malthael wanted resurrection, so I made a contract with him, I will help him find a body that suits him and he will become a member of our Burning Hell!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This body is Inarius?&quot; Roy understood &quot;Inarius has worn out his mind in endless torture, and Malthael&#x27;s Mobius Mark and soul can control the actions of this body in him, The power of death can also be well integrated with the darkness, the appearance is Inarius, but the inside is Malthael, using him as the vanguard of hell, Lilith will definitely be fooled, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right!&quot; All the seven demon kings laughed smugly together.</p>
<p>Roy inwardly sighed as he contemplated the situation. The denizens of Hell, those old timers, truly possessed an abundance of deceitful tactics up their sleeves. It appeared that the impending catastrophe loomed over the world of Sanctuary.</p>
<p>And quietly, without a doubt, Lilith had likely arrived. The question remained: what would be her next move?</p>
