<p>Roy squeezed Benia&#x27;s tail, and rubbed Julia&#x27;s wing roots, before they were about to go limp, he helped them stand up again.</p>
<p>After asking how long has been pass in the abyss, Roy nodded and said, &quot;Where&#x27;s the army you brought here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, they are right behind us?&quot; Benia pointed to the gate of the abyss behind.</p>
<p>Roy looked up and saw Fat Tiger&#x27;s huge titan body, which had also emerged from the gate of the abyss. Sareth, was riding on the back of the fat tiger. They looked around curiously, they found that the surrounding frozen environment seemed to be no different from Frostfire City, they lost their interest quickly.</p>
<p>Then both Fat Tiger and Sareth saw Roy, Sareth waved at Roy excitedly, urging Fat Tiger to run quickly. But it was different from the past. This time, the fat tiger didn&#x27;t rush over to lick Roy like a tank. Instead, he calmly carried Sareth over slowly, and got him down in front of Roy.</p>
<p>After Fat Tiger and Sareth passed through the gate of the abyss, one after another abyss demons began to appear. The lord of the Hell Prison, Belial, and the demon lords Lady Styx were leading them through the gate of the abyss.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s the army that Julia and Benia brought from Frostfire City...</p>
<p>Sareth also flew and jumped off the fat tiger&#x27;s head. Roy reached out to catch him and said with a smile, &quot;Great, you have grown taller and heavier!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup!&quot; Sareth rubbed his nose proudly and said, &quot;Foster father, like Dante, I can completely transform into a demon!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Roy was also a little surprised &quot;Have you reached the lord level so soon? Awesome!&quot;</p>
<p>Sareth laughed, a little embarrassed. Roy looked at the fat tiger lying like a hill in front of him and asked Julia, &quot;What&#x27;s wrong with this guy? Why did he suddenly become calm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He became a father!&quot; Julia curled her lips and said, &quot;Cerberus gave birth to a litter of little three-headed dogs! So this time Cerberus didn&#x27;t follow, and Cassandra was helping to take care of those puppies.&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Roy&#x27;s eyes widened. Although Roy knew that Cerberus had been chasing after the fat tiger, he never thought that Cerberus would actually treat the fat tiger as a fool. The naive and straight male dog was won. During the period when he was not in Frostfire City, Fat Tiger became a father!?</p>
<p>Roy is really a question mark in his head. In other words, when he created Fat Tiger, did he add fertility to him? Or did the system complete it for him?</p>
<p>&quot;Tsk, what a big change!&quot; Roy felt a bit of a headache when he thought that there might be a bunch of silly little fat tigers circling around him after he went back. Regardless, after looking at the troops that were sent from the gate of the abyss one after another, the iceberg will unable to stand anymore. Roy only think about it now and use his frost power to start to expand the scope of the iceberg.</p>
<p>During the period of Roy&#x27;s departure, Julia and Benia were not idle, and they have been expanding Roy&#x27;s demon army. They constantly recruited a large number of demons from the upper and middle layers of the abyss world. With the recruitment of a large number of high-ranking demons, coupled with the demon lords like Belial, the Overlord of the Hell Prison, and Lady Styx, Roy&#x27;s Demon King&#x27;s army has grown quite large.</p>
<p>After another period of time, the number of demons pouring out of the gate of the abyss has begun to decrease, and the gate of the abyss is slowly closing. Mrs. Styx danced her pair of dark phoenix tailed demon butterfly wings behind her and came to Roy &quot;Your Majesty, your demon army has been assembled, the lower demons are about 400.000, the middle demon is about 100.000, and the upper demons are about 10.000, waiting for your order.&quot;</p>
<p>Roy nodded, this number was almost enough. so he praised Mrs. Styx He, making Mrs. Styx smile.</p>
<p>The Overlord of the Flame Prison, Belial, this big flaming cow came over with his sword of flame. It could be seen that the frozen environment around him made him very uncomfortable. He came to Roy and lowered his head. Salute to Roy, and then sprayed with sparks and asked, &quot;Your Majesty, are you calling us this time to destroy the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, our opponents may be seven demon kings!&quot; Roy replied.</p>
<p>These words suddenly made Belial almost stumble to the ground. He looked at Roy in disbelief and said, &quot;Seven... seven demon kings?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it&#x27;s eight, or more!&quot; Roy silently counted Inarius and Lilith, making Belial even more speechless.</p>
<p>However, out of the worship of Roy&#x27;s powerful power, all the demon lords did not have much doubts. They would do whatever Roy told them to do, even if it was to fight the Demon King.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Julia asked worriedly &quot;What&#x27;s the matter? Darling, have you and Mephisto turned against each other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Almost, this world is very unique, you must understand that the humans you see are all Sareth&#x27;s kind! They are all descendants born from the union of angels and demons! &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he heard Roy&#x27;s words, Sareth&#x27;s eyes lit up and he hurriedly asked, &quot;Really foster father?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right! They are all Nephilim like you, Dante, and Virgil, but in this world, they are called Nephalem, with a slightly different pronunciation. So For this special world, I want to keep it, not let it be destroyed, but Mephisto and his brothers, this time became our competitors...&quot;</p>
<p>Benia understood &quot;This world Mephisto has been operating for many years. They have a huge army, but the demons here will only obey them, so you asked us to bring your army here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; Roy nodded, that&#x27;s true, the demons in the Burning Hell can be said to be the subordinates of the Seven Demon Kings, even when they attacked the High Heaven before under the command of Roy, they follow Roy&#x27;s order following order of the Seven Deadly Sins to destroy High Heaven. Even their were bound to the furnace of hell, so they would only recognize the Seven Deadly Sins as their masters. It is impossible for the demons to turn their heads and attack the Seven Demon Kings.</p>
<p>Prior to launching an assault on the High Heavens, Roy relied on the aid of the Seven Demon Kings&#x27; demon army to distract and engage the four archangels, including Imperius. The situation remains the same now. To confront them in the realm of the Seven Demon Kings, Roy must gather his own forces. Having an army to contend with the enemy&#x27;s cannon fodder is essential, which is why he seeks to summon Julia and the others to bolster his ranks.</p>
<p>In the face of the Seven Demon Kings, he is still a too weak...</p>
<p>In addition, this world also has a star soul Titan Trag&#x27;Oul, and a Red Sea Queen Lilith. Although I don&#x27;t know if it will really fight, Roy always has to plan ahead.</p>
<p>After listening to the situation that Roy is facing now, Benia wondered for a while and said &quot;Then these troops may not be enough, we need to summon more. Also the high-end combat power is also lacking, Julia and I are not enough. Maybe we should fusion and become Junia...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter, we still have time!&quot; Roy nodded and said &quot;The number of troops is not enough, then open the gate of the abyss and summon it again, and now we are still in the stage of watching the play, the Seven Demon Kings are not only my opponent! &quot;</p>
<p>Next, Belial and Lady Styx went to rectify the army, while Julia Benia and Sareth surrounded Roy, chattering about what happened after Roy left. During this period of time, the war situation in Sanctuary has also undergone tremendous changes.</p>
<p>When the territory of human beings was constantly falling under the offensive of the army of hell, when the resistance of human beings became more and more difficult, the necromancers of the Rathma sect appeared. These necromancers who hadn&#x27;t been accepted by the world were brought with the undead army and joined the front line against the demons. With the help of the immortal undead army, mankind finally stand their ground under the attack of the demons.</p>
<p>However, what makes people feel strange is that these necromancers, who have long upheld the principle of balance, seemed to deviate from their own name. Rather than advocating for the concept of balance as they had done before, they shifted their focus to emphasizing that the Nephalem themselves were burdened with the sins of their mother.</p>
<p>For once, the Seven Demon Kings, even Roy were wrong in their estimation. Lilith may have returned, but when the humans in Sanctuary were attacked by the army of demons, Lilith did not immediately stand up to protect her children. Although Lilith is indeed the mother of the Nephalems and she also has motherhood, but she is still and always be a demon. At first, because of Uldyssian&#x27;s rebellion against her, she was banished to the Void. It can&#x27;t be forgiven so easily!</p>
<p>For that, even if Mendeln welcomed her back again, in hope to get Lilith&#x27;s help in the next disaster, Lilith will not full fill it immediately. She will take action, as soon as Nephalem confessed to her and got her forgiveness.</p>
<p>Despite Mendeln&#x27;s willingness to welcome Lilith back once more, hoping for her assistance in future disaster, Lilith would not immediately oblige. She would only take action once a Nephalem confessed their transgressions to her and beg her forgiveness.</p>
<p>This is why the necromancers of the Rathma sect have suddenly emerged, advocating the concept of the original sin. With Mendeln present, they are among the first to comprehend the gravity of the original sin war. Now, they aim to spread the message of this historical conflict, urging people to repent and seek redemption from Lilith.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this endeavor proved futile rather swiftly. For many Nephalem, whose lifespans are relatively short, events that occurred thousands of years ago are distant memories. They display a profound indifference towards such matters. Moreover, since they have never personally witnessed the existence of the &quot;Mother of Nephalem,&quot; the concept holds little weight in their minds. Additionally, the somber demeanor and appearance of the Necromancers contribute to an inherent distrust among ordinary Nephalem. In fact, many individuals have subconsciously developed conspiracy theories, questioning whether the necromancers harbor ulterior motives aimed at seizing their souls.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are a few individuals who ended up believe in the necromancers preach. However, their numbers is small and still lack the capacity to sway the will of other peoples. Contradictions and differences have always been inherent in human society, and this remains true in the present circumstances.</p>
<p>The necromancers, who have long secluded themselves from society and immersed in dealings with the dead, were caught off guard by this turn of events. Their devotion to Trag&#x27;Oul&#x27;s doctrine of balance led them astray, causing a significant lack of understanding of human society. Paradoxically, their unintended influence inadvertently provided a respite for the human defense line. The kingdoms, bolstered by this newfound confidence, started to believe in their own abilities once more. They no longer felt reliant on a Nephalem Mother to rescue them, but rather believed in the capability of humanity to vanquish the demons on their own.</p>
<p>The situation remained consistent. Just as the Nephalem heroes who had triumphed over Diablo in the High Heavens were sought out by the ruling class, urging them to return to the battlefield and confront the forces of Hell once more in an attempt to defeat Inarius, confusion reigned among the necromancers and the Seven Deadly Sins. Inarius had not yet brought forth Lilith?</p>
<p>Contrary to the perplexity of others, only Roy comprehended the full picture. As Roy, aided by his Imps&#x27; reconnaissance, pondered the matter, he surmised that Lilith&#x27;s delay in taking action likely stemmed from her anticipation of an opportune moment, which might just be unfolding at present. Roy himself was engaged in a similar endeavor—amassing his own army.</p>
