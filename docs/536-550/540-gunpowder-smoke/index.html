<p>On the seventh day after the Hellfire Council was held, a huge gate of Hell opened in the kingdom of Kehjistan in Sanctuary, and the army of Hell poured out from the gate like a tide.</p>
<p>The Burning Hell officially launched an attack on Sanctuary and the one who led this army of Hell was Inarius or Malthael who had just been released from the prison!</p>
<p>The creator of the Sanctuary, the father of Nephalem, has gone completely mad. The long torment of the Seven Demon Kings for thousands of years has completely defeated his mind, and the dark power of the flaming hell has completely corrupted him into He was a fallen angel. After being released, although he recovered his body and limbs, the light wings behind him had turned gray and black. What filled his brain was only endless hatred and fear. I just want to vent my crazy thoughts that want to destroy everything.</p>
<p>In the land Inarius once created, Inarius wreaked havoc of immense proportions. In a mere day, the kingdom of Kehjistan was left in ruins. The ground, trodden upon by Inarius and his hellish army, was scorched and blackened by relentless flames. Rivers that once flowed now ran dry, their beds cracked. The once-vibrant foliage withered away, and the once-teeming wildlife perished. In the wake of their destruction, an army of maggots and flies descended upon the decaying remains, feasting upon the spoils of decay. Forests became engulfed in flames, while poisonous mists wafted through the marshlands.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, human skeletons can be seen everywhere. They may have been adventurers, thieves, or soldiers of the human kingdom in their lifetimes, but now they are lying on the ground. Their swords are broken, their armor is tattered, and their flesh and blood have long been torn by demons. The bones are full of gnawing marks, all kinds of poisonous insects get in and out of the skeleton&#x27;s eye sockets, and the earth is dead silent. The carrion-eating crows and vultures in the sky emit cheerful and strange chirping, like countless souls howling, constantly cursing the purgatory-like world.</p>
<p>The tragedy of the kingdom of Kehjistan soon spread throughout the Sanctuary. Although after the destruction of the High Heaven, the kingdoms of the Sanctuary had already anticipated the invasion of the Hell Army and made some defenses against it, but They didn&#x27;t expect the demons to come so quickly, so they were caught off guard.</p>
<p>It has to be said that the humans in Sanctuary still have their own inferiority. Before the demons of Hell really came, the kingdoms were still fighting each other, kings and nobles, nobles and nobles, and religions and religions. Bullshit, they were not able to form a real unified resistance front and alliance, even when the kingdom of Kehjistan asked for help from the neighboring kingdoms, the neighboring kingdoms were still reluctant to believe it because of their own financial and interest issues.</p>
<p>It was not until the news of the destruction of the kingdom of Kehjistan came that the kingdoms in Sanctuary woke up like a dream. The sense of crisis of genocide really came to them at this time. Humans hurriedly recruited soldiers, formed a defense line, and resisted the demons invasion.</p>
<p>Although the angels are not very friendly to the humans in the Sanctuary, Angles still the mortal enemies of the demon. In the past, when the High Heaven was still standing, heaven would definitely send an army to fight the demon in this situation. Now the High Heaven is gone and human beings can only rely on themselves. Up until this moment, those who partook in the expulsion of angels felt regretful. They have come to the realization that, unwittingly, they themselves buried the much-needed reinforcements that were rightfully theirs. Even if it is too late to regret, the people of Sanctuary can only fight.</p>
<p>At borders of various kingdoms have ignited beacon fires representing the invasion of demons. They opened the door of the treasury and distribute a large number of armors and weapons, hurriedly sending their soldiers to the frontier.</p>
<p>Humans in the Sanctuary all have Nephalem blood, the difference is only thin or not. Most of the soldiers actually still have a certain combat ability, they can use swords and weapons proficiently, and also have certain magical ability. After passing through training, the battle formation and defense line they formed can deal with ordinary demons, but the middle, upper, lord, and king in the army of Hell need more powerful Nephalems to deal with.</p>
<p>These powerful elite Nephalem warriors are generally trained in various religious organizations. Fortunately, at the time of human survival, these religious organizations also knew the benefits and sent their most powerful warriors to the front line.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Kehjistan, once a mighty realm within the world of Sanctuary, served as the birthplace of the mage tribe. However, owing to the inquisitive nature of mages, seekers of truth, they ventured to test the limits even on the original demons inhabiting Sanctuary. It was through magical experimentation that the existence of the Burning Hells was revealed. Subsequently, due to conflicts within the mage tribe, the kingdom&#x27;s decline was swift. Not too long ago, Kehjistan faced further turmoil when it fell under the rule of Belial, the Lord of Lies, who seized control even at the cost of their king&#x27;s life.</p>
<p>Although this is a very tragic country, due to its special geographical location, it was chosen by the Burning Hell as the outbreak site of this invasion. The Kingdom of Kehjistan is in the center of the Sanctuary world. When the army of demon emerge, it will soon spread to the whole world, forming an attack that blooms from the middle. The advantage of this is that the army of Hell can attack the surrounding kingdoms at the same time, forcing the human defense line to lengthen infinitely.</p>
<p>This kind of strategy was proposed by Azmodan, a Hell warrior. He is one of the few strategic talents who can command large-scale wars among the Seven Demon Kings. Of course, this time he did not show up in person, but let Inarius stand in the front. The fallen Inarius is now the best tool in Burning Hell.</p>
<p>The defense line is stretched and human resistance becomes very tight. The number of Nephalem elite warriors with strong power is relatively small. After investing in the defense lines of various places, it is only a drop in the bucket, even if humans have tried their best to resist. From time to time, kingdoms fell, cities turned into ruins, and fertile fields turned into scorched earth.</p>
<p>Desperation spreads quietly among ordinary humans, especially after news from the front line informing humans  that the one who brought the army of Hell to attack Sanctuary this time turned out to be their former creator Inarius, this kind of bad news frustrated them even more.</p>
<p>Even in this circumstances, the Nephalems still have a strong spirit of resistance in their bones. They have resisted angels, demons, and even their own mothers, so it seems that it is not difficult to resist their father now. Ordinary nephalems may feel pessimistic, but those elite nephalem warriors who have awakened the power of nephalem and continue to grow stronger in battle will not go down easily. A counter-attack was launched towards the army of hell, and many soldiers even reached the depths of the enemy camp at one point, trying to execute the decapitation tactics on Inarius.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s just that the angel Inarius is power can&#x27;t be compere to, even for the elite nephalem. He used to be Tyrael&#x27;s deputy and was second only to the five archangels. Compared with the demons, he is above the lord, the quasi demon king.</p>
<p>After creating Sanctuary, he has always been the master of the World Stone,and tuning the World Stone can not only weaken Nephalem, but also strengthen himself. When it existed, Inarius was the strongest in Sanctuary, and if it wasn&#x27;t for that, he wouldn&#x27;t have been able to exile Lilith. Although the Worldstone is destroyed, Inarius can no longer use the power of the Worldstone, but Mephisto brought him the Mobius Mark of Malthael...</p>
<p>Now, Inarius possesses a formidable combat prowess comparable to that of an archangel or a Demon King. He proves to be a challenging adversary for the forces of Hell. Among the group of Nephalem warriors who joined forces to defeat Diablo, it proves exceptionally challenging for the remaining Nephalem to defeat him. Despite multiple attempts to overpower him through various strategies, Inarius take the lives of numerous Nephalem in return.</p>
<hr />
<p>In just over two months, the army of Hell led by Inarius, spread like cancer cells. Spreading throughout the entire Sanctuary and make everything into ruin.</p>
<p>During this period, Roy, Mephisto, and the Seven Demon Kings, didn&#x27;t showed up. They hid behind the scenes to observe, cause they knew that Lilith would definitely show up.</p>
<p>Roy did not continue to stay in the Burning Hell. He had no intention to go to Burning Hell to compete with the Seven Devils for the limited territory of Hell and he didn&#x27;t like it either. After Inarius led his army to the expedition, Roy left Burning Hell alone. He came directly to the frozen sea, he found a huge iceberg on the sea to land, while observing the Imp who stayed in the Sanctuary. The development of the war, while slowly depicting the magic circle here, preparing to summon a huge gate of the abyss here.</p>
<p>The Seven Demon Kings didn&#x27;t know what Roy had done. Given that Roy hid after his arrival and then suddenly broke out to tie the High Heaven, the Seven Demon Kings did not feel too strange about Roy&#x27;s disappearance. They just thought that Roy planned something again.</p>
<p>Roy never show his hostility to other Demon Kings so vividly. It make other Demon Kings never thought Roy do harm to them. They though Roy disappearance is to deal with Lilith&#x27;s revenge, of course, they are happy to see Roy succeed.</p>
<p>As the world of Sanctuary became shrouded in smoke, Roy&#x27;s gate to the abyss was nearing completion. Given that Sanctuary resides within the space of purgatory, establishing a direct connection to the abyss world would cause a tremendous disturbance. Roy, being aware of this, strategically chose a location on the frozen sea for his gate. This ensured that even with significant activity, mortal beings would remain silent to it. The sole entity who could potentially sense and comprehend such a phenomenon, the star-soul titan Trag&#x27;Oul, would surely think twice before intervening to halt Roy&#x27;s plans.</p>
<p>With the power of Demon King Roy, the gate of the abyss that has been opened is very huge. The height of the black gate of the abyss is more than 1,000 meters. After stabilizing with an ominous aura, the first person to fly out of the gate of the abyss is Rafaro. Lorna&#x27;s huge head.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, another new world?&quot;</p>
<p>With the high-pitched dragon roar, his huge body continuously extended from the fault space of the Abyss Gate. Rafaro&#x27;s telepathy voice reach Roy&#x27;s mind and said to Roy &quot;My master, after so long, have you finally remembered to summon me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#x27;t talk nonsense!&quot; Roy snorted coldly &quot;Are Julia and Benia here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They right behind me!&quot; Rafaro responded, his body finally fully drilled out of the abyss gate, hovered in the sky. Then two petite figures also emerged from the abyss, they couldn&#x27;t couldn&#x27;t wait to rush out and rushed towards Roy.</p>
<p>&quot;Honey!&quot;</p>
<p>Julia and Benia rushed into Roy&#x27;s arms excitedly and desperately sniffed the breath on Roy&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>Although the time flow rate of the world of Sanctuary is slightly different from the world of the abyss, it is not much different. Roy has been here for several years, and the world of the abyss has also passed a similar amount of time. Julia and Benia During this period of time, is going crazy thinking about Roy...</p>
