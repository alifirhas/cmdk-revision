<p>With Archangel Tyrael&#x27;s soul, Roy returned to his Cave.</p>
<p>He sat down on the Frozen Throne with satisfaction, and gently tossed the crystal stone that sealed Tyrael&#x27;s soul in his hand. Seriously, he didn&#x27;t even expect it to go so smoothly.</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s Kanai&#x27;s box is indeed a fake to this world, but don&#x27;t forget, this is something created by Roy who invested a lot of soul in the system. It was also used to extract the Mobius Mark. It is said that this thing is an ultimate alchemy creation.</p>
<p>This time, Roy&#x27;s goal is to go to Tyrael. He is very clear that once the power of the fake Kanai&#x27;s box appears in the world of Sanctuary, it will definitely attract the attention of many people, and they will find this Even if the item does not use the synthesis formula of the genuine Kanai&#x27;s box, it can still create a powerful magic item.</p>
<p>Roy was 80-90% sure that this thing would fall into the hands of the New Horadrim Church, so he created a unique octopus demon and used it as a courier to &#x27;send&#x27; the fake Kanai&#x27;s box. Go out, the recipient is the New Horadrim Church.</p>
<p>On the fake Kanai&#x27;s box, Roy left a space-time beacon, and this space-time beacon can be perceived by Roy in general direction, so that there is no need to worry about losing things.</p>
<p>Because Roy&#x27;s Kanai&#x27;s box needs souls as fuel for alchemy, Roy judged that after the people of the Horadrim Church figured out the ability of this thing, it is likely to be sealed up. They dare not use this thing.</p>
<p>When the box is sealed, Tyrael will definitely appear. With his cautious personality, he should be able to guess that there is something wrong with this box of unknown origin, so he will pay attention to it, and may even set some kind of trap to let it go. The demon behind the box appeared.</p>
<p>This is nothing more than a process of your prejudging me and my prejudging, but Tyrael may never have thought that Roy&#x27;s real purpose in making such a turn is just to create an opportunity to meet Tyrael.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting, in Roy&#x27;s estimation, would not have too many people with Tyrael, maybe even Tyrael alone.</p>
<p>Facts have proved that this is the case. The nephalems in this world have great power, but as an archangel of High Heaven, Tyrael has not yet reached the point where he takes a vote of nephalem as his guards wherever he goes. The dignity of an angel would not allow him to do so.</p>
<p>As long as you meet Tyrael, everything will be easy. Roy also guessed that the angels may be difficult to kill, so he specially created an item with similar functions to the dark soul stone, that is, his hand this crystal stone.</p>
<p>Perhaps people in this world have long been accustomed to the fact that demons and demon kings are sealed. In their thinking, they never imagined that a demon would appear one day, and in turn would seal the soul of their archangel.</p>
<p>In contemplating this, Roy pondered the rationale behind Mephisto and his cohorts. Perhaps, in the midst of the eternal conflict, their perspectives had become entrenched. Humans had managed to employ fragments of the Dark Soul Stone to seal the Seven Demon Kings. So, could it not be possible for the Demon Kings to obtain fragments of the World Stone and fashion a Soul Stone capable of imprisoning the High Angels?</p>
<p>Such a creation shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult for the Demon King, right? Even if they are not proficient in alchemy...</p>
<p>In any case, in Roy&#x27;s plan, the first step has been completed perfectly, and the next step can be continued.</p>
<p>Holding the crystal stone, Roy shook it vigorously, and said to the golden streamer in the crystal stone &quot;Tyrael, don&#x27;t pretend to be dead, I know your consciousness is still there, and you can speak. Don&#x27;t you want to say something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Demon!&quot; The voice of Tyrael&#x27;s soul came from the crystal stone, sounding a little furious, and said: &quot;What conspiracy are you imprisoning my soul!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Conspiracy? Maybe...&quot; Roy also wanted to chat with someone and said, &quot;What I want to do is actually very simple, you just need to think about what kind of chain reaction your disappearance will cause!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My disappearance?&quot; Tyrael&#x27;s soul pondered for a while, and then said &quot;Do you want to go to war with High Heaven?&quot;</p>
<p>Roy said in surprise &quot;Huh? How did you think of this step?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are a demon, what else can you do if you don&#x27;t want to fight with angels?&quot; Tyrael asked rhetorically.</p>
<p>Roy shook his head and said, &quot;You may think that I imprisoned your soul in order to reduce the battle power of an archangel from the High Heaven, so that I can take the demon army to level the High Heaven, right? Wrong? Now, you&#x27;re thinking in the wrong direction!&quot;</p>
<p>Raising his hand, Roy used the power of frost to instantly condense a high platform of ice crystals, and placed the crystal stone on the platform. What kind of special role does it play in Sanctuary!</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; Tyrael didn&#x27;t speak.</p>
<p>&quot;After coming to this world, the reason why I haven&#x27;t done much is to use this time to study the history of this world!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I noticed that the human history of Sanctuary has many records for your High Heaven. if I remember correctly, you Archangel of Justice Tyrael, and your brother Archangel Imperius, Archangel of Hope - Auriel, Archangel of Destiny - Itherael, and Archangel of Wisdom - Malthael your five archangels formed a council of angels called Angus, which ruled the entire High Heaven and continued to fight against demons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, what&#x27;s wrong with that?&quot; Tyrael asked aloud.</p>
<p>&quot;I have seen an interesting record in human history!&quot; Roy gave a wicked smile at the crystal stone, regardless of whether Tyrael could see it or not, and said, &quot;The Nephalem in Sanctuary After appearing, you, like the demons, had fears and worries about the powerful power of the nephalem, so the Angiris Council once launched a vote to discuss whether to genocide the nephalem, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Hearing Roy mention this, Tyrael&#x27;s swimming soul stopped abruptly!</p>
<p>He suddenly realized what Roy was trying to convey...</p>
<p>&quot;In that historical record, it seems that the vote was initiated by Imperius, he voted in favor, Auriel opposed, Itherael was neutral, Malthael gave up, and both neutrality and abandonment were considered invalid, So the situation at the time was one-to-one, if you also chose to be neutral or give up at the time, Imperius could use the power of the leader to force this proposal through, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right, so I voted against it at the time...&quot; Tyrael said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&quot;It is precisely because of your vote that it played a key role, so I can see from the texts recorded in human history that they did not feel much about Auriel, who also voted against it at the time. I am very grateful to you, Tyrael! It is precisely because of this matter that your popularity among humans in Sanctuary has reached its peak.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not just me, humans are equally grateful to Auriel!&quot; Tyrael quickly defended.</p>
<p>&quot;But Auriel rarely appears in front of the world, doesn&#x27;t she?&quot; Roy said with a smile &quot;The same is true for you, although you are also a human now, but you are still an angel in your bones, so you may not be too Understand the minds of human beings, they will hold a skeptical attitude towards people or things they have not seen. Even if Auriel&#x27;s negative vote at the time helped them, they would not care, but you appeared to them. Archangel in front of them, they will pour all their gratitude on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They will think that in the entire High Heaven, only you care about the life and death of human beings. As for the other archangels, they are either indifferent to human beings, or they are hostile to human beings... Don&#x27;t doubt, that&#x27;s what they think!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...So, my disappearance will cause the relationship between the Nephalem and the High Heavens to deteriorate, isn&#x27;t that so?&quot; Tyrael said in a dejected manner.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, in my opinion, you are the most important link between humans and angels!&quot; Roy nodded and said, &quot;The reason why Mephisto Diablo and the others have failed one after another in this world is not because They can&#x27;t beat your angels, but because they can&#x27;t beat the combined army of your angels and humans!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy clenched his paw &quot;And what I&#x27;m doing now is to break your bond!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You...!&quot; Tyrael was horrified by Roy&#x27;s words and wanted to scold him loudly, but he stopped because he knew that what Roy said was the truth!</p>
<p>If the attitude of the entire High Heaven towards the Nephalems is the same as Tyrael, then Tyrael does not have to worry about his disappearance at all, but the problem is here, his brother Imperius, are very hostile!</p>
<p>The Archangel of Destiny Itherael is indifferent to human beings, while Malthael has fallen not long ago, attacking human beings as an angel of death, and wants to purify the half of the demon blood of Nephalem. It can be said that, Now in the entire High Heaven, only Auriel can stop Imperius, but if Imperius does his own thing, then as the leader, he may really bring all the angels to execute the Nephalem. purified...</p>
<p>What&#x27;s more, there is now a new demon king like Roy in Sanctuary. If he provokes it, the relationship between Nephalem and angels should not deteriorate too quickly...</p>
<p>The current Nephalems are like a double-edged sword. Their unique blood of both angels and demons is destined for them to be used by angels and demons, no matter which side they fall to, the other side. It&#x27;s all a huge damage!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Tyrael was also anxious. His soul was slamming around in the crystal stone, trying to escape. However, he underestimated the crystal stone cage made by Roy. His soul was tossing a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, why did Mephisto bring a demon like you to this world!?&quot; Tyrael roared angrily &quot;Can&#x27;t you just stay in your abyss world? Why come here to harm this world!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That said, only your Angiris Council is allowed to execute genocide against the Nephalems, but are we not allowed to win over the Nephalems?&quot; Roy snorted &quot;Your double standards are too serious. right?&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, in Roy&#x27;s opinion, whether it is an angel or a demon, it is not a good bird. Needless to say, the demon is just because they have the special effect of the Holy Light, so they confuse the human being. There is also the saying that the angel blows the trumpet to destroy the world, and it also destroys the world. What is the difference between the two?</p>
<p>Besides, when did Roy say that he was going to destroy the world and destroy mankind? Tyrael is suffering from paranoia, right?</p>
<p>What he is doing now is nothing more than making arrangements for a possible future war with the High Heaven... As for whether it will really work, it depends... When Lilith returns!</p>
<p>Roy ignored Tyrael&#x27;s shout and sat back on the throne to think.</p>
<p>The fact that the dark soul stone has been destroyed is beyond Roy&#x27;s expectations. Mephisto and the seven demon kings have actually escaped. If they were not wrong, their souls may have already been in the abyss oven. Reborn, but this guy Mephisto pretended to be trapped and found himself from the abyss world, the purpose of which is worth pondering...</p>
