<p>Rakkis&#x27;s tomb, located deep underground, is the burial ground of a general who was famous in the history of Sanctuary.</p>
<p>This is the place where the Dark Soul Stone was previously stored. Since the Dark Soul Stone imprisoned the souls of the Seven Demon Kings, the Dark Soul Stone at that time exuded an evil breath all the time, even angels may be polluted and contaminated by these evil breaths. Corruption, which made Tyrael unable to place the dark soul stone in the High Heaven to guard, as a last resort, he could only find the tomb of Rakkis in the Sanctuary, which was used to place the dark soul stone.</p>
<p>Now, there is one more thing in this tomb, and that is the imitation of Kanai&#x27;s box.</p>
<p>The people of the Church of New Horadrim were surprised by Tyrael&#x27;s decision, because the Dark Soul Stone was stored in the tomb of Rakkis, which led to the attack of the angel of death Malthael. How dare you store things here?</p>
<p>However, their trust in Archangel Tyrael made them choose to execute the order.</p>
<p>Among all the archangels in the high heavens, none has had a greater and more profound impact on the inhabitants of Sanctuary than Tyrael. He unwaveringly stood against the Archangel of Courage, Imperius, in order to safeguard humanity. While the other archangels contemplated the eradication of humans due to their fears and concerns about the Nephalem powers, it was Tyrael who vehemently opposed such actions. As a result, people firmly believe that it is only Archangel Tyrael who stands as their protector.</p>
<p>The place where the imitation of Kanai&#x27;s box is stored is in the same place as the dark soul stone. After the placement was completed, the Horadrim closed the gate of the tomb and sent a lot of guards to guard it.</p>
<p>After the imitation of Kanai&#x27;s box was placed, Tyrael seemed to have forgotten about this matter and began to focus on other affairs, and it seemed that everything was business as usual.</p>
<p>But no one knows that Tyrael has been secretly paying attention to the situation of Rakkis&#x27;s tomb...</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days.</p>
<p>Time passed quietly, and soon two weeks passed. During this period, nothing major happened in the entire Sanctuary, and the tomb of Rakkis was silent.</p>
<p>However, just that night, the imitation of Kanai&#x27;s box placed on the altar in the Rakkis&#x27;s tomb trembled violently, and a powerful space force shot out from the box, and then not far away A portal has opened!</p>
<p>A pair of demon claws clambered on the edge of the portal, and then Roy walked out of the portal, the huge reverse wings tucked behind him, and the misty body perfectly blended in the darkness of the tomb, only the pair Scarlet eyes, leaving swaying tracks in the dark.</p>
<p>After walking out of the portal, Roy began to look around. He saw many tall statues with swords around them. These statues guarded a huge tomb. There seemed to be some mechanism in this tomb, and the top seemed to be openable.</p>
<p>Roy first stretched out his hand and took down his Kanai&#x27;s box from the altar and then walked to the tomb.</p>
<p>But just as he was about to approach the tomb, a strong light appeared from behind him, the light gradually converged into a human shape, and then Archangel Tyrael appeared!</p>
<p>In his hand, he was holding his holy sword, the brilliance of the holy feather. As soon as he appeared, Tyrael pointed at Roy&#x27;s figure from the back with this holy sword, and said in a stern tone &quot;Don&#x27;t be delusional, Demon! There&#x27;s nothing in that tomb!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Roy turned around slowly, showing a wicked smile, and said, &quot;So, the dark soul stone was transferred by you?&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrael looked like a human at this time, and he stared at Roy closely. This was the first time he saw Roy&#x27;s appearance, and he finally saw the true appearance of this new demon king.</p>
<p>Whether it is Diablo or Mephisto, the Seven Demon Kings are all hideous, and their bodies are not many humanoids, more like monsters than human beings, but the Demon Lord Osiris in front of him is different. There are very few monster parts on the body, except for the tail and wings, the whole looks like a humanoid.</p>
<p>However, this does not imply that the pressure he exerts has diminished. On the contrary, Tyrael feels a heightened sense of unease and vigilance when confronted with Roy. He is well aware that Roy embodies the epitome of an Abyssal Demon, adhering strictly to their demonic nature.</p>
<p>This guy, as expected, came from the place where the Demon originated...</p>
<p>Although Tyrael did not dare to be careless when facing Roy, the feeling of &quot;caught you&quot; in his heart still infected him. After hearing Roy&#x27;s words, Tyrael couldn&#x27;t help but feel With a smile on his face, he said &quot;Demon, you think of us too simply, there is a faint space-time beacon on that weird Kanai&#x27;s box replica, you don&#x27;t think we really can&#x27;t check it out. Bar?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right!&quot; Roy nodded and admitted generously &quot;That was set by me, through a &#x27;courier&#x27;, to let you get this box, and then I tracked the time-space beacon on the box and Come.&quot;</p>
<p>What is a courier? That weird octopus demon?</p>
<p>Tyrael thought in his heart and said, &quot;It seems that I guessed right. Your purpose is still the Dark Soul Stone, right? Demon Osiris, I don&#x27;t know who you were bewitched by when you came to this world. But what I&#x27;m saying is, you&#x27;ve been fooled! The person who confuses you has deceived you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Roy reached out and stroked the Demon&#x27;s horn on his head, turning it from time to time to make him feel physically and mentally happy.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no dark soul stone!&quot; Tyrael smiled: &quot;It&#x27;s not that we transferred the dark soul stone, but it has been completely destroyed!&quot;</p>
<p>What Tyrael said is true. During the battle with the Angel of Death, Malthael extracted the power from the dark soul stone, causing the soul stone to become fragile. The thing that was destroyed suddenly appeared weak, so that it shattered in the war.</p>
<p>Only Tyrael and Nephalem who participated in the war at that time knew about this matter...</p>
<p>Since the Seven Demon Kings were sealed in the Dark Soul Stone, the destruction of the Soul Stone meant that Mephisto, Diablo and the others had actually escaped the cage. Perhaps they became weak due to the extraction of their soul power, but the Seven Demon Kings made a comeback. It&#x27;s almost a sure thing.</p>
<p>This is definitely a terrible thing for the humans in Sanctuary. In order to appease the people, Tyrael and the Nephalems who participated in the war did not dare to tell the truth. I returned to the Dark Soul Stone and sealed it.</p>
<p>After all, fear, these negative emotions will strengthen the power of the Seven Demon Kings...</p>
<p>Of course, this is only a temporary measure, so in fact Tyrael and the others are already preparing for the war when the Seven Demons make a comeback in the future. They will really wait until the Seven Demons reappear before they announce the news of the destruction of the Dark Soul Stone.</p>
<p>After hearing Tyrael&#x27;s words, Roy also seemed a little surprised.</p>
<p>The truth is concealed, so there will be no relevant historical records in the books around the world. Through the exploration of the Demon&#x27;s eye, it is naturally impossible for him to know these hidden truths.</p>
<p>&quot;So, this is just a trap?&quot; Roy said.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Tyrael couldn&#x27;t help laughing. A sense of thwarting the demon&#x27;s conspiracy emerged spontaneously. He pointed at Roy with his sword and said, &quot;Yes, this is a trap, but I didn&#x27;t expect it. It&#x27;s actually you who came in person! I thought it would be another man-made demon...&quot;</p>
<p>Roy slowly took out Frostmourne from the system space, and with a slam, Roy stuck the tip of his sword on the ground. Grab the sword with both hands, and said to Tyrael in a strange tone &quot;The trap you mentioned is only you. Are you alone?&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrael shook his head and the light wings of the archangel slowly appeared behind him. The fluttering light wings represented that the power of his archangel was condensing.</p>
<p>&quot;Faced with a demon like you, ordinary people are just dying, so I&#x27;m enough alone!&quot;</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, Tyrael&#x27;s figure turned into a rapid ray of light. He held the brilliance of the holy sword and the holy feather and attacked Roy directly.</p>
<p>clang!</p>
<p>Frostmourne blocked the slash of Holy Feather&#x27;s brilliance. The collision of the holy sword and the magic sword not only brought a huge sound, but also brought an incomparably powerful radiation. Archangel Tyrael&#x27;s holy sword The power of light and the dark power of the Demon King Roy, after the conflict between the two, a big explosion occurred in an instant, and the entire Rakkis&#x27;s tomb was directly destroyed by this powerful force!</p>
<p>A huge deep pit appeared on the spot, at the bottom of the pit, Roy and Tyrael stood face to face, their swords crossed, like an epic picture, there was a wrestling between two mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Tyrael clenched his teeth, attempting to overpower Roy, but in that moment, Roy&#x27;s smile widened. He released his grip on the sword with his right hand and swiftly delivered a powerful punch to Tyrael&#x27;s blackened visage.</p>
<p>The sixty-four times the power by Red Dragon Emperor&#x27;s Gauntlet exploded in an instant. Tyrael, the archangel, was hit by this punch and flew up in the air, twisting his entire body several times and then smashed to the ground.</p>
<p>It can be seen that half of Tyrael&#x27;s face collapsed on the ground...</p>
<p>Before Tyrael could recover from the dizziness, the next moment, a fog-like chaotic energy group spurted out and smashed on Tyrael&#x27;s body.</p>
<p>In the face of this chaotic energy, Tyrael&#x27;s powerful holy light protection was like that of a paper lake, and he was easily broken through the defense.</p>
<p>A huge explosion occurred and Tyrael&#x27;s body was thrown out again like a tattered rag doll.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ve never been struck with such force before...&quot;</p>
<p>In the severe pain and confusion, Tyrael had such a thought in his mind, but before he could regain his senses, Roy&#x27;s joking voice came from his ears again.</p>
<p>&quot;Then have you ever thought that the mastermind of your trap is me?&quot;</p>
