<p>Since he came at the invitation of Mephisto, Roy didn&#x27;t bring Julia and Benia together when Roy didn&#x27;t know anything about the world of Sanctuary. Not only them, Roy also let Sareth and the fat tiger stay in the abyss world obediently.</p>
<p>So now in the world of Sanctuary, Roy is alone and it is very convenient to move.</p>
<p>Since coming and disappearing, Roy has been teleported in the coldest direction in the world. There is a lonely scene of ice and snow here. There are no signs of life activities within a radius of hundreds of kilometers, so Roy himself does not know where he is. Where is the place, but it doesn&#x27;t matter, tens of thousands of demon eyes are constantly sending pictures towards him at the moment, so many pictures, Roy may not be able to deal with it in the past, but now he has After the quantum body, he found that his brain&#x27;s ability to process information skyrocketed.</p>
<p>A part of the eyes of the demons who were sent to high altitudes came with a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the world of Sanctuary. The world of Sanctuary is quite huge. It has two huge lands next to each other and around the land is endless. The entire world is also in the shape of a sphere, but strangely, when Roy ordered the demon eyes to keep flying upwards, he accidentally hit a thick barrier!</p>
<p>This invisible barrier seems to be an incomparably huge barrier, which shrouds the entire world of Sanctuary, and even if the Devil&#x27;s Eye does not pass through this barrier, Roy can feel it. Outside the barrier is a larger space, and this space is very familiar to Roy.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a purgatory space...</p>
<p>Roy nodded thoughtfully, and he realized that the purgatory space outside is probably the space where heaven and angle are located in this world.</p>
<p>It turns out that this Sanctuary is a lonely boat born in the ocean of purgatory space? No wonder when I saw the information of Sanctuary before, I felt that the information was artificially modified. It seems that this world was really &quot;made&quot;...</p>
<p>Roy did not let the Devil&#x27;s Eye break through the barrier, because the breakthrough process may cause the Devil&#x27;s Eye to be detected by the outer heaven or hell. Roy shifted his attention to other Devil&#x27;s eyes.</p>
<p>After tens of thousands of demon eyes were scattered on the two huge lands in Sanctuary, they also seemed very sparse, but as time passed, Roy also saw one by one in the picture. Human gathering points, these human gathering points are large or small, ranging from a few hundred people in a village to hundreds of thousands in a city. You can see the farmland that has been reclaimed on the periphery of the gathering area, and you can also see the shuttle in the gathering area. Caravans between lands.</p>
<p>In a world where there are upper rank angels and many demon kings, these humans living in the Sanctuary can&#x27;t see too much decadence and numbness. Human civilization can still have such vitality, which has to make Roy Amazed.</p>
<p>Of course, this may also be related to the fact that the Seven Demon Kings were sealed and the Sanctuary ushered in a brief peace...</p>
<p>After leaving the human gathering place, it is a different scene in the outskirts of the wilderness. Wandering demonic creatures, greed for blood and soul in their hungry eyes, wanting to kill any living creature they can see...</p>
<p>When he saw these pictures, Roy really felt the cruelty of this world to humans. I am afraid that those human gathering places were only developed after paying a huge price.</p>
<p>In the prying eyes of the devil, Roy also saw the extraordinary power possessed by humans in the Sanctuary. There are mages who understand elements and magic, and there are crusaders who have obtained the power of holy light because of their faith and piety. There are also necromancers who study darkness and death, demon hunters who focus on lurking and assassination skills, and barbarian warriors who fight with powerful physical strength. These humans with extraordinary power have a unified name in this world are Nephalem!</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s Devil&#x27;s Eye, in the books of some human gathering places, found the history recorded in the Sanctuary. The strange thing is that this war-torn world has a complete inheritance of history and in these historical places. In the records, Roy found the origins of the Nephalems.</p>
<p>In the history of Sanctuary, it is said that everything in this world comes from the creator God Anu. He is the only existence in the world, a existence intertwined with good and evil. He decided to purify himself and discard his evil in a dream. The evil that was abandoned eventually evolved into a seven-headed dragon: Tathamet!</p>
<p>God Anu and Tathamet fought an eternal struggle, and in the end, the two creatures delivered the final blow, shattering each other at the same time.</p>
<p>The seven dragon heads of Tathamet  became the seven demon kings of hell, God Anu&#x27;s spine became the crystal arch of the High Heaven, his eyes became a world stone with great power, and Angels and demons scrambled around the world stone and started the eternal battle.</p>
<p>Roy doesn&#x27;t know if such a creation myth is true. In Roy&#x27;s impression, the abyss is the origin of all demons. The demons of other worlds actually came from the abyss world at first, so this myth It seems that has a lot of fallacies, but after all, this is recorded by human beings. For them, there are too many illusions in the too long history, so it is normal to make mistakes.</p>
<p>The so-called Nephalem is actually the first generation of humans in the Sanctuary. There was no Sanctuary in this world. In the endless purgatory space, angels and demons staged an eternal battle that lasted for thousands of years. Unfortunately, The thing is, because the strength of the two sides is basically equal, no one can do anything about the other. The state of the two sides is divided into five and five, it can be said that the entire eternal battle has continued.</p>
<p>After all, angels and demons are intelligent creatures, and they have been fighting for too long. Naturally, like the world of dark blood, angels and demons began to get tired of the eternal battle.</p>
<p>These angels and demons who are tired of the eternal battle are represented by the high-ranking angels Inarius and Lilith...</p>
<p>Here, Roy encountered another revelation that left him perplexed. According to the historical records of Sanctuary, Lilith was revealed to be none other than Mephisto&#x27;s daughter. Weary of the ceaseless conflict, she conspired with Inarius to steal the World Stone housed within the Chaos Fortress of the Purgatory Space. Utilizing the power of the World Stone, they established a refuge known as Sanctuary, where those angels and demons who shared their weariness of eternal warfare sought solace. It was during this time that Lilith and Inarius forged a deep bond, giving rise to a remarkable progeny born of both angelic and demonic heritage—the Nephalem, who became the first generation of humans.</p>
<p>This is the origin of Nephalem in this world, which makes Roy look like a bullshit. You must know that in Roy&#x27;s impression, Lilith is on the same level as the original sin demon kings, and her appearance is also the same as the original sin demon king. We were in the same period, and Mephisto, the demon king, was the next batch of demon kings. Even if he was also old enough, how could He dare to be Lilith&#x27;s father? ?</p>
<p>Thinking about it, Roy suddenly became crooked, eh? Maybe it&#x27;s the kind of relationship called [2] Papakatsu?</p>
<p>Shaking his head and putting aside this strange thought for a while, Roy continued to check those historical books, maybe there was something wrong with the relationship between Lilith and Mephisto, but to say that Lilith created Nephalem, Roy Rather believe it.</p>
<p>It is said that after the union of Inarius and Lilith, the first generation of nephalems was born. Because of their mixed blood, the nephalems were born with powerful powers, which even surpassed angels and demons. As time passed, the power they displayed also began to disturb the angels and demons of Sanctuary, so the angels and demons thought about clearing these Nephalem from Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Lilith sensed the thoughts of these angels and demons, and felt that they dared to attack their own children, so in a fit of rage, she killed all the angels and demons in the Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Inarius was furious at this, because the Sanctuary was created by him and Lilith, and Inarius felt that he was the real king. Inarius exiled Lilith in a fit of rage and she was exiled to the purgatory space In the void beyond!</p>
<p>This situation resembled a form of domestic turmoil. Following Lilith&#x27;s exile, Inarius redirected his rage towards his own children. However, he also acknowledged that the immense power of the Nephalem surpassed his control. In an attempt to diminish their power, he manipulated the energy frequency of the World Stone, the cornerstone of Sanctuary.</p>
<p>His plan was successful. Affected by the decay of the energy frequency of the World Stone, the descendants of the Nephalems were unable to inherit the knowledge and power of their ancestors in their souls as before, so they began to weaken gradually.</p>
<p>However, Inarius, being a perpetrator of domestic violence, did not meet a favorable fate in the end. His act of stealing the World Stone branded him as a traitor in the eyes of Heaven. Eventually, a pact was formed between Heaven and Mephisto, where demons from the Burning Hells would no longer invade Sanctuary. As part of this agreement, Inarius was handed over to Mephisto as a traitor. Mephisto enacted a cruel punishment upon Inarius, severing his wings and reducing him to a frail, human-like figure. To ensure he could never escape his torment, Mephisto also removed Inarius&#x27; eyelids, forcing him to constantly witness his own decaying body. Inarius was confined within a chamber adorned with mirrors, where his twisted form served as a perpetual reminder of his wretched state.</p>
<p>Although an agreement has been reached with the heaven side, saying that they will no longer enter the world of Sanctuary, if the demon really abides by the agreement, it will not be called a demon, especially for an ancient demon like Mephisto. After seeing the great potential of the Nephalems, he thought of using the power of the Nephalems as a bargaining chip to overwhelm the balance of the eternal battle. So he, Diablo and Baal, the seven demon kings began to find ways to drill the loopholes in the agreement. Many years later, when the human mages in Sanctuary were studying magic, the hell demons tempted them, and let the human mages summon them from the purgatory space to Sanctuary again.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m not going, it&#x27;s humans who summoned us, we didn&#x27;t violate the agreement!&quot;</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what it means...</p>
<p>As a result, the demons began to invade the world of Sanctuary. They corrupted and seduced humans, the descendants of Nephalem, and used them to turn their heads against the angels. The power of Nephalem is both good and evil, so Being able to control them easily, the heaven side had no choice but to intervene in the affairs of the world again. The two sides began to burn the war from purgatory space to the place of sanctuary.</p>
<p>Humans were unwilling to be destroyed by demons, so they also began to use the power of angels to expel the demons.</p>
<p>In the following history, it was recorded that Mephisto, Diablo and the other demon kings were sealed one after another. Roy immediately found the doubt after carefully checking these records.</p>
<p>&quot;Soul stone?!&quot;</p>
<p>Roy frowned. In the records, Mephisto and the other demon kings were all sealed by this thing. It is said that this soul stone is derived from the world stone, just like Inarius can adjust the world by adjusting the world. Just like the frequency of the stone to reduce the power of the Nephalem, the soul stone also has the effect of restraining and reducing the power of the devil. It is precisely because of the existence of the soul stone that demon kings like Mephisto Diablo, It can only be sealed in this world with hatred.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the real reason why they keep failing in this world!&quot; Roy concluded &quot;If this thing can seal the power of the Demon King, it means that it is also a dangerous item for me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Does this thing still exist? Mephisto and the others wouldn&#x27;t be so stupid. They knew that the Soul Stone was a weakness, so they didn&#x27;t choose to destroy it!&quot; Roy thought &quot;Or, this thing can&#x27;t be destroyed?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Information, I need more information about the Soul Stone!&quot; Roy made a decision: &quot;Especially in the recent information, Mephisto did not say that his brother Diablo had gathered the Seven Demon Kings before. Has the power been reborn once and counterattacked the High Heaven? After Diablo left, where did the soul stone go?&quot;</p>
