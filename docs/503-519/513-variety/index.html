<p>Tyrael&#x27;s soul was Imperiusoned in the crystal stone by Roy. Unless Tyrael&#x27;s soul power can surpass that of Roy, he will not be able to break through in a short time.</p>
<p>Imperiusoning Tyrael is equivalent to letting him fall. For a long time to come, Tyrael will no longer be able to interfere with the human world in Sanctuary and what Roy has to do is to wait.</p>
<p>The disappearance of Tyrael will take time to ferment and the relationship between Nephalem and the angel will not deteriorate immediately. To achieve Roy&#x27;s ideal In that state, he also needs enough patience.</p>
<p>Of course, waiting does not mean that Roy does nothing. In fact, after considering several follow-up developments after Tyrael&#x27;s disappearance, Roy thinks that he needs an army, a huge army of demons, in order to use Deal with a possible attack from the High Heavens.</p>
<p>As long as you don&#x27;t hide in the purgatory space of the flame hell, then in the world of Sanctuary, Roy&#x27;s whereabouts will be discovered sooner or later. After all, the High Heaven has lost an archangel and this archangel It is not as degenerate as Malthael, so it is certain that after finding out that Roy did not perish with Tyrael, the High Heaven will definitely take revenge on Roy.</p>
<p>In this case, a powerful army of demons is essential for Roy. He is even thinking about whether to summon Julia, Beniam, and the others to this world to manage the army for him.</p>
<p>Given Roy&#x27;s current position as a demon king, amassing an army of demons requires minimal effort. Thanks to Mephisto and the other six demon kings of Diablo, regions far removed from human civilization within the vast world of Sanctuary are teeming with demons, monsters, undead, fallen beings, and other creatures. These entities, lacking a unified authority, roam aimlessly across the wilderness, forming diverse communities and factions. Engaged in constant battles for territory, they vie for dominance and often resort to cannibalizing their adversaries.</p>
<p>Even so, those monsters with demon bloodline still have the class inheritance engraved in their bones. As long as Roy is summoned as a demon king, they will soon gather and become part of Roy&#x27;s demon army.</p>
<p>Of course, it is still relatively early for the war and Roy does not need too many troops. If there are too many, it will be difficult to support them unless a war is launched against the human beings in the Sanctuary to plunder their souls, but this has nothing to do with Roy&#x27;s plan. Once the demon attacks humans, it will make them closer to the angels.</p>
<p>The contradiction between humans and angels can only be manifested without the invasion of demons, so what Roy has to do is to try to maintain the current peaceful situation in the entire Sanctuary.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a while, Roy decided to try his best to subdue the powerful demons and monsters from all over the world. By restraining these guys, he would restrain more low-level monsters and prevent them from invading human territory for the time being.</p>
<p>Therefore, Roy&#x27;s first step was to gather the monsters around the Xiansai Island where he was.</p>
<p>Yes, Roy has figured out where he is now. This is the northernmost part of the world of Sanctuary, on an island that can be said to be isolated from the world. The name of this place is called [2] Xiansai!</p>
<p>Xiansai is a huge island. It is located in the frozen sea. It is isolated by the sea on all sides, and adjacent to it are the two landmasses of Sanctuary, Scosglen and Dreadlands. Diablo has already been there and his octopus demon &#x27;the courier&#x27; was placed in Dreadlands. and Tristram was the hometown of Diablo in the Land of Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Because it is separated by a wide strait, Xiansai Island can be said to be inaccessible, but this does not mean that there are no people on the land of this island. In fact, when flying over Xiansai Island from a high altitude before, Roy discovered that Near the southern coast, there is a city where people gather.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that the architectural style of this human city is very oriental. The people living here also look like oriental people with black hair, and the name of this city is actually called &quot;Zhoucheng&quot;!</p>
<p>Roy was curious to observe the city through the invisible eyes of the demon, and he found that apart from their appearance, the people here were no different from those in other places in Sanctuary, and they were all from the blood of Nephalem.</p>
<p>People who have not awakened the power of the bloodline are no different from ordinary human civilians, but if the Nephalem bloodline is awakened, the people here have a strong affinity for the elements. Although they are isolated from the world, in their historical records, for every a few years, people from the outside Sanctuary will come to select those gifted children to go back to accept the inheritance of the mage.</p>
<p>In other words, this place is an important source of students for the profession of world mage in Sanctuary...</p>
<p>Roy&#x27;s location is in the mountains further north of Xiansai Island, and it is quite far away from this human city. Due to the cold climate in the north, the people in Zhoucheng did not explore the mountains. It means that it can be said that he has nothing to do with Roy for the time being and Roy himself does not want to break this balance for the time being.</p>
<p>Deep in the mountains, there are a large number of groups of snowmen and ice demons. When Roy&#x27;s power was released, these monsters with weak demon blood began to move closer to Roy&#x27;s location. It didn&#x27;t take long for Roy to gather thousands of troops under his command.</p>
<p>These tall snowmen and ice demons have enormous power. Under Roy&#x27;s order, they worked hard and began to build the demon&#x27;s Palace for Roy.</p>
<p>Roy is also a demon king with status now and he still needs to have some pomp...</p>
<p>The Xiansai people knew nothing about the lively scene deep in the mountains, and they continued their lives, which could be regarded as covering for Roy&#x27;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>A year passed quickly. During this year, Roy&#x27;s Demon King&#x27;s Palace was also completed and the snowmen and ice demon tribes within a radius of nearly 500 kilometers were all under his control. However, these monsters were restrained by Roy and stayed in the mountains. Only those humans who recklessly entered the snow-capped mountains would be expelled and killed by them, even the people of Xiansai felt a little surprised. Days seem to be more stable than before.</p>
<p>In the course of this year, the consequences of Tyrael&#x27;s disappearance have gradually spread.</p>
<p>The New Horadrim Church was originally founded by Tyrael. After losing Tyrael as a leader, the New Horadrim Church was in a state of leaderless. They began to argue internally about what the Church should do next. Incessantly, some people do not believe that Archangel Tyrael is really dead, so they suggest looking for Tyrael&#x27;s whereabouts, while others suggest expanding the power of the church to prevent the comeback of the Seven demons, and some people think that they should contact the High Heaven as soon as possible. In short, the internal opinions are chaotic.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the elite Nephalem warriors with powerful power in the Horadrim Church are not the management. This has to be said to be a mistake by Tyrael. These warriors are usually only responsible for combat. They rarely interfere in internal affairs, which leads to the fact that in the case of internal chaos, they can&#x27;t speak at all, and no one wants to listen to their opinions.</p>
<p>The top leaders of the church did not take into account the feelings of these warriors, so as time passed, these warriors gradually became a little disheartened. They would rather fight the demon to the death than get involved in this kind of power struggle.</p>
<p>But... in the human history of Sanctuary, there has never been a lack of such a power struggle. This is the nature of human beings, even Tyrael can&#x27;t understand it.</p>
<p>During this period, high-ranking celestial messengers were dispatched to inquire about Tyrael&#x27;s whereabouts. Concern arose as Tyrael had not returned to the High Heavens for the customary debriefing, and his soul had not been reborn within the Crystal Arch. News of his whereabouts had been lost for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>At this inquiry, the people of the Horadrim Church could only tell the truth and told their guesses to the messenger of the High Heaven, saying that Tyrael may have perished with the Demon King Osiris.</p>
<p>When this news was passed back to the High Heaven and was known by Imperius, the archangel was furious!</p>
<p>Although there have been disputes in the past, Tyrael is Imperius&#x27; brother after all. In the long eternal battle, Tyrael has always fought side by side with Imperius. Such friendship cannot be erased by disputes...</p>
<p>The whereabouts of his brother are unknown, but these mortals have only reported the news until now. This can no longer be described as a missed opportunity...</p>
<p>However, Imperius did not consider this possibility either. He maintained a constant vigilance and harbored deep distrust towards the nephalem. From the outset, he sought to eradicate these sanctuaries, leading the High Heavens to cease establishing any liaison offices in the mortal world. Previously, Tyrael served as a means to convey information, but with his absence, the Horadrim Church has lost the ability to contact the High Heavens.</p>
<p>In spite of his prejudice, Imperius could not help but turn his anger on humans. He ordered the Horadrim Church to find out Tyrael&#x27;s whereabouts at all costs. Come, then don&#x27;t blame High Heaven for being rude to them!</p>
<p>The Horadrim Church, accustomed to Tyrael&#x27;s gentle demeanor, found such a demanding order highly unsettling. Taking their feelings to the side, they could only strive to fulfill it to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p>But the toughness of the angels aroused the unhappiness of the Nephalem warriors. When Diablo came back from the Dark Soul Stone and gathered the power of the Seven Demon Kings to lead the demon army into the High Heaven, the High Heaven was fundamentally unhappy. Unable to resist, it was Tyrael who brought these Nephalem warriors to help High Heaven defeat Diablo.</p>
<p>When Imperius was beaten to death by Diablo and now he is still commanding the Nephalem warriors with such a tough attitude, of course they will be unhappy in their hearts.</p>
<p>So, the crack was created at this moment...</p>
<p>And, it will get bigger and bigger...</p>
